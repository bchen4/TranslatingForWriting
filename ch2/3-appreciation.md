## Part 6

- "I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives."

	我知道。过错大了，他本来可能和我们一起打鱼。我们此生也就光耀门楣了。

	我记得。那是个打错。他也许真会**跟**我们去。那真够我们**乐**一辈子。

- Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."

- "When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening." 

	我像你这么大的时候，正在去非洲的一条老式帆船上做水手，到黄昏还看见岸上的狮子。

	“在你这个年龄，我站在桅杆前，在一条去往非洲装着横帆的船上，晚上我看到了沙滩上的狮子。”

- "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager." 


- "I think they are equal. "And the best fisherman is you."

	“我认为他们实力相当。要说最好的渔夫当然是你。”

	“我看他们不相上下，可是最能干的渔夫是你。”

- "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you."

	“哪里！”男孩说。“有许多不错的渔夫，也有些很厉害。但你是唯一的。”

	“哪里话，”男孩说，“能干的渔夫很多，了不起的也有几个。可是像你这样的，只有一个。”

- "Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong. 

    “谢谢你。你让我很开心。我希望大鱼遇到我会绕开，证明我们是错的。”

	“谢谢你，你**逗**我开心了。我希望不会有太大的鱼来**戳穿**我们的大话。”

## Part 7

- They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark.

	饭桌上没灯他们吃完后，老人脱下裤子摸黑上床了。

	他们用餐时，桌上没有灯光，老人也在暗中脱裤上床。 

- He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.

	他把裤子卷起来做成一个枕头，把报纸塞进裤子里面。他把自己裹在毛毯里，睡在铺着报纸的弹簧垫上。

	他把报纸**夹**在裤子里，卷起来做个枕头。他用毯子裹住身体，睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。

- He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it.

	他现在每天晚上住在海岸边，在梦里听见海浪咆哮，当地的船只冲在浪潮上迎过来。
	
	如今他夜夜重回那岸旁，在梦中听见**波涛拍岸**，又看见土人的小舟来去**乘潮**。

- He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. 

	风暴、女人、大事件、大鱼、战斗、角力和他的妻子，他再也没有梦到过。他现在只梦见不同地方和沙滩上的狮子。

	他不再梦见狂风暴雨，或者女人，或者大场面，或者巨鱼，或者拳赛，或者角力，或者亡妻。如今他只梦见各种地方和岸上的狮子。

- He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on.
	
	他睁着眼睛，透过敞开的门看到外面的月亮，抚平裤子穿上。

	他**就这么**醒来，透过敞开的门**凝望**晓月，又**抖**开裤子穿上。

- He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.He was shivering with the morning cold. 

	他去棚屋外解手，然后沿着马路向上走，去叫醒男孩。清晨的低温冻得他直打哆嗦。

	他在屋外小便罢，便**一路走上坡去**，唤醒男孩。**晓寒**里他索索发抖。

- The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. 

	男孩在第一间房的围床里睡着，月亮的余光照进来，老人可以清晰地看到男孩。

	男孩熟睡在第一间房里的小床上；借着**落月**透进来的**清光**，老人**一眼**就看到他。

- The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.

	老人点点头，男孩拿起床边椅子上的裤子，坐在床沿上穿好裤子。

	老人点点头，男孩便**提起**床边椅上的裤子，坐在床上，穿上裤子。

- They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.

	他们沿着马路往下走回老人的棚屋，漆黑黑的路上，光着脚的人往前走，身上扛着船的桅杆。

	他们一路向老人的小屋走去。昏暗中，沿路都有**赤脚的渔人**掮着**自己的**船桅走动。

## Part 8

- They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. 

	他们去了一家招待早起渔夫的地方喝咖啡，那里的咖啡出自浓缩的牛奶罐。

	他们到专做渔人生意的**早食店**里，**用炼乳罐头盛咖啡喝**。

- "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." 

	“我知道，”男孩说。“我马上回来。你再喝一杯。我们在这里有信誉。”

	“我马上就回来。再黑一杯咖啡吧。我们可以记账。”

- He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. 

	男孩光着脚走~~在~~珊瑚礁~~上~~，往存鱼饵的冰库走去。

	他赤脚**踩着**珊瑚岩石，向藏饵的冰屋走去。

- The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it.

	老人慢慢地喝着他的咖啡。这是他全天的能量补给，他知道得喝下去。

	老人缓缓地饮着咖啡。**一天的就吃这些了了**，他知道非吃不行。

- they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.

	他们沿着小路下到小船停靠处，脚下的沙砾混着石头,然后举起船放到水里。

	两人**踩着**夹有卵石的沙地，顺着小径，走到船边，把船抬起来，推下海去。

- Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines.Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-gar-land on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could fell which was not sweet smelling and good tasting. 

	每只鱼饵头朝下，鱼身穿过鱼钩手柄，系好缝牢实，鱼钩所有伸出来的部分、弯曲的地方和钩尖全都包着新鲜的沙丁鱼。每条沙丁鱼用钩子穿住两只眼睛，这样伸出的钢铁部分构成半环状。任何大鱼可能上钩的位置，没有一处不香甜可口。

-  They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.

	划出港口后他们就各自分开了，每个渔夫划向一片海，希望在那里捕到鱼。老人知道他要去很远的海，任陆地的味道渐行渐远，他迎着清晨澄澈的味道划向大海。

	出了港口，他们便四面散开，各人向自己有望捕鱼的地方

- He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean. 

	他划过那片渔夫称作“大水井”的海时，看到水里马尾藻的美景：“大水井”深700英寻，因为潮流形成的漩涡与海底陡峭的水墙反向，各种各样的鱼聚集在这里。

- Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.

	这里有大量虾和饵鱼，有时深洞里的乌贼夜里成群涌上水面，成为所有附近游鱼的美餐。

## 9

- In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness.  

夜里老人感到天色渐起，划船时他听到飞鱼离开水面抖动的声音，和挺直的翅膀在夜里飞驰发出的嘶嘶声。

- He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.

他为鸟感到难过，尤其是那些细小纤弱的黑燕鸥，它们飞个不停寻找什么，但几乎从来找不到什么。他觉得这些鸟活得比人艰辛，除了一些强盗鸟和强壮的大鸟。

- Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea.  

为什么他们把鸟弄成像海燕一样纤细弱小，而大海却如此残忍？她善良美丽。但她能如此残忍，突然暴起，让这些触水追寻、低怨哀鸣的飞鸟触不及防。

- Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine.

- But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.
