The Old Man and The Sea   
by Ernest Hemingway    
Part6-10    

## Part 6 
"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid." 

“你记得他什么时候来过天台吗？我想带他去打鱼但是没敢问他。然后我让你去问你也不敢。”

"I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives."

我知道。过错大了，他本来可能和我们一起打鱼。我们此生也就光耀门楣了。

"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."

“我想带了不起的迪马乔打鱼，”老人说。“他们说他的父亲是个渔夫。也许他曾经和我们一样穷，会理解的。”

"The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age."

“了不起的西斯勒的父亲从来没穷过，在我这个年龄他（父亲）正在大联盟打球。”

"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening." 

“在你这个年龄，我站在桅杆前，在一条去往非洲装着横帆的船上，晚上我看到了沙滩上的狮子。”

"I know. You told me."

“我知道。你跟我说过。”

"Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?" 

“我们该聊聊非洲还是棒球？”

"Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J. 

“我觉得棒球吧，”男孩说。“跟我说说约翰J.麦格劳”。他把Jota说成J。

"He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball.At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone."

他过去有时也来天台。但是他很粗野，说话刻薄，喝酒时还不好相处。除了棒球他的心思都在赛马上。至少他的口袋里总装着赛马名单，电话里经常提到赛马的名字。

"He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest." 

“他是个了不起的经理，”男孩说。“我爸爸认为他是最了不起的。”

"Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager." 

“那是因为他来这里最多，”老人说。“如果迪罗谢每年来这里，你爸爸会觉得他是最了不起的经理。”

"Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?" 

“最了不起的经理是谁？说着的，卢克 还是迈克·冈萨雷斯？”

"I think they are equal. "And the best fisherman is you."

“我认为他们实力相当。要说最好的渔夫当然是你。”

" No. I know others better."

我不算，我知道其他人更好。”

"Que va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you."

“哪里！”男孩说。“有许多不错的渔夫，也有些很厉害。但你是唯一的。”

"Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.

“谢谢你。你让我很开心。我希望大鱼遇到我会绕开，证明我们是错的。”

"There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say." 

如果你还像自己说的那么强，就不会有这样的鱼。

"I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution." 

“我也许不像你想象中那样强，”老人说。“但我懂很多捕鱼窍门，而且有决心。”

"You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."

“你现在该上床啦，明天早上才有精神。我把东西送回天台。”

"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning." 

“那晚安。早上我叫醒你。”

"You're my alarm clock." the boy said. 

“你是我的闹钟。”男孩说。

"Age is my alarm clock," the old man said.

“年龄是我的闹钟，”老人说。

"Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?" 

“为什么老人醒那么早？是为了让一天过得更长？”

"I don't know,” the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard." 

“我不知道，”男孩说。“我只知道年轻男孩睡得沉起得晚。”

"I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time." 

"我不会忘的，"老人说。“我会准时叫醒你。”

"I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior."

“我不喜欢他叫醒我，好像我很菜一样。”

"I know." 

“我知道。”

"Sleep well old man.

“好好睡吧老头。”

## Part 7
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.

男孩出去了。饭桌上没灯他们吃完后，老人脱下裤子摸黑上床了。他把裤子卷起来做成一个枕头，把报纸塞进裤子里面。他把自己裹在毛毯里，睡在铺着报纸的弹簧垫上。

He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. 

没多久他就睡着了，他梦见孩童时的非洲、长长的金沙滩、白得刺眼的白沙滩，耸立的海岬,褐色的高山。他现在每天晚上住在海岸边，在梦里听见海浪咆哮，当地的船只冲在浪潮上迎过来。睡觉时他闻到甲板上的沥青和棉絮，闻到陆地上的晨风吹来的非洲味道。

Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.

一般只要闻到从陆地吹来的微风，他就醒了，然后穿好衣服去叫醒男孩。但是今晚陆地吹来的味道来得很早，在梦里他知道风来得太早，于是继续梦见从海上升起的海岛顶峰，然后又梦见加那利群岛不同的港口和停泊所.

He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing. 

风暴、女人、大事件、大鱼、战斗、角力和他的妻子，他再也没有梦到过。他现在只梦见不同地方和沙滩上的狮子。他睁着眼睛，透过敞开的门看到外面的月亮，抚平裤子穿上。他去棚屋外解手，然后沿着马路向上走，去叫醒男孩。清晨的低温冻得他直打哆嗦。但他知道打哆嗦会让他渐渐暖和起来，而且马上他就要去划船了。

The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.

男孩住的房子没锁门，老人推开门，光着脚轻轻走进去。男孩在第一间房的围床里睡着，月亮的余光照进来，老人可以清晰地看到男孩。他轻轻地握住男孩的一只脚，直到男孩醒了翻过身来看着他。老人点点头，男孩拿起床边椅子上的裤子，坐在床沿上穿好裤子。

The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry." 

老人走出来，男孩跟着他。他还未睡醒，老人搂着他的肩膀说，“对不起。”

"Que'va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do." 

“哪里！”男孩说。“这是一个男人该做的。”

They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.

他们沿着马路往下走回老人的棚屋，漆黑黑的路上，光着脚的人往前走，身上扛着船的桅杆。

When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.

## Part 8
"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. 

“你想来杯咖啡吗？”男孩问。

"We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. 

“我们先把渔具放到船上然后喝点咖啡。”他们去了一家招待早起渔夫的地方喝咖啡，那里的咖啡出自浓缩的牛奶罐。

"How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. 

“老头你睡得怎样？”男孩问。他现在醒着，虽然还是很难摆脱睡意。

"Very well, Manolin," the old man said."I feel confident today." 

“睡得很好，马诺林，”老人说。“我今天觉得信心十足。”

"So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."

“我也是，”男孩说。“现在我得去拿我们各自的沙丁鱼，还有你的鱼饵。他自己带我们的渔具。他从来不让任何人拿他的东西。”

"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." 

“我们不同，”老人说。“你5岁我就开始让你拿东西了。”

"I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." 

“我知道，”男孩说。“我马上回来。你再喝一杯。我们这里的账户有余额。”

He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. 

男孩光着脚走在珊瑚礁上，往存鱼饵的冰库走去。

The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.

老人慢慢地喝着他的咖啡。这是他全天的能量补给，他知道得喝下去。长时间以来吃饭对老人是一件麻烦事，他从来没有带过午餐。船头一瓶水，够他一天用。

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.

男孩回来了，拿着沙丁鱼和两条用报纸包好的鱼饵。他们沿着小路下到小船停靠处，脚下的沙砾混着石头,然后举起船放到水里。

"Good luck old man."

“祝你好运，老头。”

"Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.

“祝我好运，”老人说。他把桨的绳圈安在桨栓上，身子前倾以缓冲桨叶在水里的推力，他开始划出黑暗中的港湾。其它海滩的船也出海了，虽然月亮落到山下老人看不到他们，但可以听到他们船桨下水和划动的声音。

Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.

有时船上有人声。但大多数船沉寂无语除了桨声。划出港口后他们就各自分开了，每个渔夫划向一片海，希望在那里捕到鱼。老人知道他要去很远的海，任陆地的味道渐行渐远，他迎着清晨澄澈的味道划向大海。他划过那片渔夫称作“大水井”的海时，看到水里马尾藻的美景：“大水井”深700英寻，因为潮流形成的漩涡与海底陡峭的水墙反向，各种各样的鱼聚集在这里。这里有大量虾和饵鱼，有时深洞里的乌贼夜里成群涌上水面，成为所有附近游鱼的美餐。
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Part 9
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.

夜里老人感到天色渐起，划船时他听到飞鱼离开水面抖动的声音，和挺直的翅膀在夜里飞驰发出的嘶嘶声。他非常喜欢飞鱼，因为它们是他在大海里的主要朋友。他为鸟感到难过，尤其是那些细小纤弱的黑燕鸥，它们飞个不停寻找什么，但几乎从来找不到什么。他觉得这些鸟活得比人艰辛，除了一些强盗鸟和强壮的大鸟。

Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea. 

为什么他们把鸟弄成像海燕一样纤细弱小，而大海却如此残忍？她善良美丽。但她能如此残忍，突然暴起，让这些触水追寻、低怨哀鸣的飞鸟触不及防。

He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought. 

他总是把大海当成“海姑娘”,西班牙语中人们对她的爱称。有时那些爱她的人讲她的坏话，但她还是被当作一个女人。一些年轻的渔夫——他们用浮标当作钓索的浮子，他们有摩托潜艇，这些都是用鲨鱼肝卖钱买来的——把她说成男性称谓的“海汉子”。他们把她当作一位竞争对手、或者一个地点甚至一位敌人。但年长的人总是把她当作女性，他们认为她既能赐予亦能收回莫大的恩惠，如果她做了什么狂野或者恶意的事情那是因为她无法避免它们。他想，月亮对她的影响跟对女人的影响是一样的。

He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

他划得很平稳，这对他不是难事，因为他的速度控制得很好，海面也很平静，除了偶尔的涡流之外。他让海流承担三分之一的工作，随着天色渐亮，他看到自己已经划出很远了，比他预想中这个时刻应在的位置更远。

I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them. 

他想，我在深井忙活了一星期什么都没有。今天我要找到成群的鲣鱼和长鳍金枪鱼，也许有一条大鱼跟它们一起。

Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-gar-land on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could fell which was not sweet smelling and good tasting. 

天大亮之前，他把鱼饵放出去，任船随海流漂浮。一只鱼饵放到40英寻深的地方，第二只75英寻，第三只和第四只深入蓝色的海下面，分别位于100英寻和125英寻处。每只鱼饵头朝下，鱼身穿过鱼钩手柄，系好缝牢实，鱼钩所有伸出来的部分、弯曲的地方和钩尖全都包着新鲜的沙丁鱼。每条沙丁鱼用钩子穿住两只眼睛，这样伸出的钢铁部分构成半环状。任何大鱼可能上钩的位置，没有一处不香甜可口。
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Part 10
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line. 
男孩给他两条新鲜的小金枪鱼,又叫长鳍金枪鱼 ,悬在两根最长的线上像plummet一样，另外两根线是之前用过的a big blue runner and a yellow jack，但还是in good condition，穿的沙丁鱼散发出引诱的香味。每根绳子，和一只大铅笔一样粗细， looped onto a green-sapped stick ，一旦鱼饵被拉动或触碰，棍子就会dip,每条线有两卷40英尺的绕绳，which could be made fast to the other spare coils。如果必要，一条鱼会用到300英尺的绳索。

Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise. 
现在老人看着船边的三根棍子dip,轻轻划桨，保持线在各自合适的深度竖直上下浮动。天很亮，这个时候太阳随时可能升起来。

The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred. 
太阳从海上露出来，老人能见到海流附近的其他船，吃水不深，正往海岸划去。接着太阳越来越亮，阳光射在海面上，然后随着它逐渐清晰，平静的海面把阳光反射在他眼睛里，非常晃眼睛，他划着船避免看向海面。他看向水下，观察钓索垂入水深暗处。他比任何人更注重钓索笔直朝下，这样在任何洋流的任何深度上都有鱼饵静候可能游过的任何一条鱼。其他人让钓索随着洋流漂浮，有时候只有60英尺深，但渔夫误以为是100英尺。

But, he thought, I keep them with precision.Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. 
但是老人想，我要确保他们毫无误差。只有我已经用完运气了。但谁知道？也许是今天。每天都是崭新的一天。有运气当然更好，但我宁愿自己更准确。等运气来的时候你就准备好了。

The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore.
太阳现在有两小时的高了，看东边已经不那么刺眼。现在只能看见3条小船，它们看起来都很浅，远在海岸那边了。


All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
我的人生里，清晨的太阳伤了我的眼睛，他想。然而它们还很健康。晚上我能直视它不会两眼发黑。晚上的太阳也更强。但早上它令人痛苦。

Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again. 
刚刚他看见一只长黑翼的man-of-war bird 盘旋在他前面的天空上。他猛地俯冲下去，slanting down on his back-swept wings，然后又开始盘旋。

"He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking." 
“他一定发现什么了，”老人大声说。“他可不是随便看看。”

He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.
他划得又慢又稳，划向那只鸟盘旋的地方。他不着急，让钓索笔直上下浮动。他绕开洋流一点点，保证自己还在正确的方向，只是比先前没打算利用这只鸟的时候划得更快些。

The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then be dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface. 
鸟飞得越来越高，又开始盘旋起来，双翼静止不动。然后突然潜入海面，老人看到飞鱼跳出水面，在海面滑翔。

"Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin." 
“鲯鳅，”老人大声说道。“大鲯鳅。”

He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow.He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water. 
他把桨放起来，从船头下面拿来一条小绳子。绳子有一个线头和一个中等大小的钓钩，他用一条沙丁鱼穿在上面做鱼饵。他把线垂到船边，made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. 然后他穿另一条绳子的鱼饵，随它船头shade缠绕着。他继续回去划船，观察长翼黑鸟此时正盘旋在贴近水面的地方。

As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphins were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.
他正看着的时候，黑鸟张起翅膀再一次扎入海面，然后用力慌乱地煽动翅膀追逐飞鱼。老人可以看到bulge大鲯鳅鱼追逐逃逸的鱼时升到海面上。鲯鳅鱼。鲯鳅鱼划过水面，在飞鱼的下面，然后留在水里，当鱼掉下来时飞快追赶。这是一大群鲯鳅，他想。他们正在窃窃私语，飞鱼了无机会。黑鸟也毫无机会。飞鱼对他来说太大了，而且他们速度很快。

He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.
他看着飞鱼一次又一次地蹦出来，黑鸟徒劳无功的追逐。那群鲯鳅已经离开我了，他想。他们游得太快太远了。但也许我会碰到一套stray，也许我的大鱼就在他们附近。我的大鱼一定在什么地方。

The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish.The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man of war floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
陆地上空的云朵升起来像高山一样，海岸只剩下一条长长的绿线，后面是灰蓝色的小山。现在的水是深蓝色，颜色深得几乎成了紫色。老人看向水里，他看到水深暗处的plankton red sifting，和太阳照在海里的奇怪的光。他查看自己的钓索，确保笔直伸到水下看不见的地方。他很开心看到这么多的plankton，说明附近有鱼。太阳照在水里的奇怪的光，现在太阳升得更高了，预示接下来是好天气，陆地上空的云朵形状同样预示了好天气。但是现在几乎看不到那只鸟了，海面上什么也没有，只有Sargasso weed和bladder漂浮在船附近。
