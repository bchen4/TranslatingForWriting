# Classic Style Is Not Practical Style
# 古典风格不是实用风格

In the model scene behind practical style, the reader has a problem to solve, a decision to make, a ruling to hand down, an inquiry to conduct, a machine to design or repair—in short, a job to do. The reader’s need, not the writer’s desire to articulate something, initiates the writing. The writer’s job is to serve the reader’s immediate need by delivering timely materials. The motive can thus be almost anything productive of a need: greed, enterprise, competition, philanthropy. Since the reader is engaged in solving a problem, the reading is not an end in itself, it is instrumental to some other end. That is why, in this scene, the prime stylistic virtue is ease of parsing. In practical style, the best presentation will allow the reader to acquire timely information with a minimum of distraction because, in this scene, writing is an instrument for delivering information with maximum efficiency and in such a way as to place the smallest possible burden upon the reader, who has other—more important—burdens to bear.

实用风格的典型场景是，读者要解决一个问题、做出一个决定、宣布一项裁决、开展一项调查、设计或修理一台机器，总之要做一项任务。正是读者的需要——而非作者要表达某种东西的欲望——激发了写作。作者的工作是提供合适的材料满足读者的迫切需求。因此凡是能引发需求的都可以成为动机：贪婪、上进、比赛、慈善。读者要解决问题，那么阅读不是目的，而是辅助达到其它目的的工具。这就是为什么这种场景的主要文体特点是易于解读。对实用风格来讲，最好的呈现是让读者最快地获取信息且尽量减少干扰，在这种场景中，写作目的是高效地传达信息，同时尽可能减少读者的负担，因为读者有更重要的要务在身。

In classic style, by contrast, neither writer nor reader has a job, the writing and reading do not serve a practical goal, and the writer has all the time in the world to present her subject as something interesting for its own sake. Her characteristic brevity comes from the elegance of her mind, never from pressures of time or employment. The writing is initiated by the writer, not the reader: the writer wants to present something not to a client, but to an indefinite audience, treated as if it were a single individual. Her motive is to present truth, not so that someone can use it to accomplish a practical goal, although someone might make use of it for such a purpose, but for its own sake.

相反，古典风格的作者和读者都没有任务在身，写作和阅读不用服务于某个实用目的，作者有充分的时间呈现他的话题，只为话题本身的趣味。他的标志性的简洁源于思想的优雅，从不受迫于时间和雇主。发起写作的是作者，而非读者：作者呈现的对象不是客户，而是不确定的读者，就好像读者是一位单独的个体。写作动机是呈现真相，而不是帮助某人达到实用目的，虽然某人可能把它用于这样的目的，但还是为了真相本身。

Classic style and practical style have important areas of overlap; both styles place a high value on clarity and directness. Classic style values clarity because it sees itself as a transparent medium for the presentation of truth. Practical style values clarity because it places a premium on being easy to parse. Both styles can be described as precise and efficient, but for quite different reasons: practical style is precise and efficient because the reader wants to understand well and quickly for the purpose of making immediate use of what he is reading; classic style is precise and efficient because precision serves truth and because efficiency is a refinement. The efficiency of classic style is a sign of its having the leisure and luxury to afford refinement: the writer and reader have had all the time needed to train their minds to the requisite concert pitch.

古典风格和实用风格有重要的相同点：两种风格都注重清晰直接。古典风格的清晰是因为它把自己看成一种呈现真相的透明媒介。实用风格的清晰是为了便于读者解析语法结构。两种风格都说得上准确和高效，但原因各异：实用风格准确高效是因为读者想快速准确地理解阅读内容以便立即运用；古典风格准确高效是因为准确服务于真相，高效源于精炼。古典风格的高效说明它有足够的闲暇和安逸慢慢精炼：作者和读者均有充分的时间训练他们的思想，达到必要的标准。

Neither classic style nor practical style contains much of the sort of internal network of cross-references that linguists call “metadiscourse” (“I would like to tell you about X but first I have to tell you about y”). In classic style, such explicit acknowledgment of planning defeats the immediacy and spontaneity that mark the style’s model scene, conversation. In practical style, a network of cross-references, clotting the text, is a poor substitute for less distracting indications of coherence.

古典风格和实用风格没有太多文内的交叉引用，语言学家将之称作“元话语”（我想和你讲讲X，但在此之前我要先讲讲Y）。古典风格认为，这种直白地承认语言经过事先计划的方式，破坏了古典风格的典型场景——即时自发的对话。在实用风格中，交叉引用会使文本瘀堵不畅，是连贯的拙劣替代品，因为交叉引用容易让读者分心。

There are a few recognizable prototypes of the model scene of practical style. The first, drawn from the world of corporate business or the legal profession, is a memorandum to a superior who has asked for information. The writer knows more about the subject than the reader, but it is the reader who will make a decision or take action, and so stands in need of some of the writer’s knowledge. The reader’s need is the motive for writing. A second prototype is a memorandum to a subordinate whose activities the superior is trying to direct and manage. In neither case does the reader want or expect to know everything the writer knows about the subject. Practical style is selective in a way that classic style is not. The cast is hierarchical, not symmetric. Clustered around these prototypes are recognizable extensions: the manual telling someone how to perform routine jobs; the manual telling someone how to use something; the how-to book instructing the CEO in the art of negotiation; the book about financial planning telling those with discretionary income how to invest it; the advisory from a manufacturer to owners of the manufactured product telling them that it has a defect and how to get it fixed.

实用风格的典型场景有一些常见的原型。第一种源自公司业务人士或法律人士，向上级写备忘录提供必要信息。作者比读者知道更多主题内容，但读者是决策方或采取行动的人，所以需要部分作者的知识。读者的需求引发写作动机。第二种原型是上级向下属写备忘录指导和管理其活动。在这两类场合中，读者不想也不打算知道作者关于主题的全部知识。实用风格有选择倾向，但古典风格没有。它的读者和作者有层级划分，并非对等。这些原型衍生了很多相关类型：常规工作执行手册；物品使用手册；教CEO谈判艺术的入门指南；教有自主支配收入的人投资的理财书；制造品厂商向用户提供的维修手册。

Another prototype of this scene is the delivery of the results of research to fellow researchers, which is to say, fellow insiders. The writer knows more about his own research than the readers do, but they are fellow professionals who expect to know everything he knows as a result of reading his report, or know at least what they need to know for their own purposes. What is reported will affect their own independent activities in ways that they alone can judge. The writer is imparting information and does not want his writing, as such, to be noticed; it should fulfill every standard expectation and be as easy to parse as possible.

这种场景的另一个原型是向研究伙伴（也就是业内知情人）发布研究结果，对自己的研究作者比读者知道得多，但他们是业内专家，希望阅读报告后知道作者知道的一切，或者达到各自目的需要了解的内容。报告内容将影响他们各自独立的活动，这些活动他们自己就能判断。作者只是传达信息，并不想别人关注他的写作。写作只需满足全部标准期望，且尽可能易于解读。

Most writing in schools and colleges is a perversion of practical style: the student pretends that he is writing a memorandum. He pretends that he knows more than the reader, that the reader needs this information, and that his job is to impart that information in a way that is easy for the reader to parse. This pretense is supposed to be practice for the real thing. Actually, the reader (the teacher) probably knows much more about the subject than the writer; the reader (the teacher) has no need whatever for the information; and the job of the writer is to cover himself from attack by his superior (the teacher). The actual scene interferes so much with the fantasy scene that the result is almost inevitably compromised, if not fraudulent.

大学及院校的写作是写作风格的误用：学生假装他写的是备忘录。他假装他知道的比读者多，读者需要他的信息，而他的工作是以读者易于解读的方式传达信息。这种假装本应是是为了练习实际的东西。事实上，读者（老师）对一个话题的了解可能比作者要多很多；读者（老师）对信息毫无需求；作者的工作是掩护自己以免受到上级（老师）的攻击。实际的场景严重妨害了理想场景，写作的结果如算不上欺骗，妥协在所难免。

The best-known teachers of practical style are Strunk and White, in their ubiquitous Elements of Style. The best teachers of practical style are Joseph Williams and Gregory Colomb, in Williams’s Style: Toward Clarity and Grace and a series of academic articles and technical reports.

实用风格最著名的老师是普遍流传的《风格要素》里的Strunk and White。实用风格最好的老师Williams 的《风格：清晰与优雅》里的Joseph Williams and Gregory Colomb和一系列学术文章和技术报告。

Strunk and White’s disarming treatment of what everybody really needs to know about writing has been treasured by generations of people who are occasionally forced to write something and view the prospect with a sinking feeling of dread. As a guide to writing, The Elements of Style, being little more than an apparently arbitrary mixture of grammatical digest, handy list of common mistakes, and expert hand-holding, is drastically incomplete, but it is a masterpiece of psychological insight. Its attractions derive, we suspect, first, from its implicit, cheery, and optimistic promise that if you just read its few pages and work those few surface tricks it teaches you (“In summaries, keep to one tense,” “less should not be used for fewer”), you will not embarrass yourself; second, from its exhortatory cheerleading that seems so assured and upbeat; and third, from its tone of common sense that masks, at key points, an essential vacuousness: “Choose a suitable design and hold to it.”

Strunk and White对每个人真正需要知道的写作的论述深入人心，受几代人的吹捧，吹捧的这些人偶尔被迫写些什么东西且对写好它们怀着沮丧和恐惧。《风格要素》很明显只不过是随意组合了语法选录、随看随用的常见错误清单和专家解读，作为一本写作指南非常不全面，但是一本心理洞察的杰作。我们怀疑，它的魅力在于以下三点：其一，含蓄的允诺足够乐观积极，如果你读上几页并按照它教你的几个表层技巧做（“总结时保持时态一致”，“不要把fewer误用为less”），你的写作就不会令你难堪；其二，规劝的呼声如此笃定和热情；其三，它那种常识的口气把一些关键之处的空泛说得很重要：“选用适宜的设计模板并遵循它。”

Such advice has the same immemorial power of “Just use your head, and you’ll be all right.” Advice of this sort has the great merit of being brief and supportive. There is a welcome assurance that there is really nothing to it, except for those truly mysterious aspects of the subject that cannot be taught at all. “I can teach you where to put a comma in ten minutes, but don’t expect me to teach you to write like Shakespeare.”

这种建议同“运用你的头脑，你就不会错”一样具有远古的魔力。这类建议的优势是简洁又鼓舞人心。除了那些真正神秘不可教授的方面，真的没有什么了，这类保证总是受人欢迎。“我可以花十分钟教你在哪里打逗号，但你不能让我把你教成莎士比亚那样。”

Williams and Colomb present an incomparably deeper and more orderly treatment of practical style. The style they present is consistent and mature; it makes decisions about all the major questions that define a style, and is fully developed. The claim behind Williams and Colomb’s treatment is large and theoretical: just as readers of an English sentence have expectations about word order and the distribution of information in a sentence, so readers of what Williams and Colomb call “pointed texts” have in their minds a grammar of such texts that tells them where to look for what. Readers will use that grammar. Writing that conforms to it will be easy for the reader to follow. Writing that resists it will be difficult for the reader to follow. For example, a reader looks for an opening section (“the issue”) and a following section (“the discussion”) within each unit of a pointed text. He looks for a rich lexical field, at the end of the issue, which will be used to weave the discussion together, to give it cohesion, as it progresses. He looks for a point at the end of the discussion. If there is a point at the end of the issue, it will be taken to be an adumbration of the point at the end of the discussion. Units of discourse nest, so that units within the discussion will themselves be composed of an issue and a discussion. These principles work themselves down to the level of the sentence, where the reader expects the first part of the sentence to present an issue (topic) and the second part of the sentence to present a discussion (comment). The reader expects old information in the sentence before new. The reader prefers to understand things in terms of actions and agents, so the backbone of a sentence should be a verb that conveys action, and the subject of such a verb should be one of the agents—perhaps metaphorical—in this action-story. Since readers link agents to actions in pairs, writers should try not to separate the subject (agent) from the verb (action) with distracting information. And so on.

Williams and Colomb对实用风格的论述要深刻和有条理得多。他们表现的风格一致且成熟；它会对所有定义风格的主要问题做出决定，发展全面。Williams and Colomb的论述主张广大且理论的：就像英语句子的读者对句子顺序和信息分布有期望一样，所以Williams and Colomb称之为“实用文本”的读者在他们的脑海中形成了这种文本语法，知道在哪里寻找什么。读者会运用这种语法阅读。如果写作运用这种语法就容易被读者理解，如果违背它就很难理解。比如，读者在实用文本的每个单元中寻找到开头部分（“议题”）和后续部分（“讨论”），议题的结尾将讨论逐步串成逻辑连贯的内容。他在讨论的末尾寻找一个问题点。如果议题结尾有这样的的问题点，那么由此可预测讨论结尾将回应这样的问题点。话语单元一层套一层，讨论内部单元本身由问题和讨论组成。这些原则适用于句子层面，读者期望句子的第一部分提出问题（话题），句子的第二部分提出讨论（评论）。读者期待旧信息在前新信息在后。读者倾向于根据行动和代理理解事情，因此，句子的骨干应该是一个表达动作的动词，并且这个动词的主语应该是这个动作故事中的动作执行者——或许是比喻性的动作执行者。由于读者将动作执行者与动作看成一对，作者应该尽量不要用其它信息把主语（动作执行者）与动词（动作）分开干扰读者注意力。如此之类还有很多。

Williams and Colomb’s finely detailed treatment of practical style provides an indispensable guide impressive in its scope and intelligence. It is missing just one thing, namely, an explicit acknowledgment of its fundamental stand, and an acknowledgment that its fundamental stand is one of many alternatives. While their work is thorough, systematic, and theoretically sophisticated, and while they know that they are dealing with just one style, the work is misleading in its self-presentation: it pretends that the style it concerns, and about which it gives excellent advice, is universal and exclusive rather than merely ubiquitous. Practical style rests on a set of answers to basic questions; other styles rest on different answers to those same questions.

Williams and Colomb对实用风格的细致详细论述为该风格提供了必要的指导，这种指导在它所涉及的范围以及体现的睿智令人印象深刻。它唯一漏了一件事，即明确承认其基本立场，承认它的基本立场是众多选择之一。虽然他们的论述详实、系统的和理论成熟，虽然他们知道他们只论及一种风格，但在自我呈现方面容易误导读者：它假装它所谈论的风格以及相应的优秀建议并非只是通用，而是普适且唯一。对基本问题的一系列回答定义了实用风格;对这些相同问题的不同回答则定义了其它风格。

Practical style comes from deciding that what matters in style is the reader, and in particular the reader’s ease in parsing features of the text, especially the discourse features of the text. Practical style is so firm in this decision that it treats it as no decision at all, but as a necessity: of course excellence of style consists in conforming to the reader’s grammatical expectations in the act of reading. Why else would anyone presume to take up a reader’s time than to solve a problem for the reader? Why then would anyone write except to inform the reader about a solution to that problem? How else can this be done aside from ordering the text so that readers can get the point before giving up in the face of the obvious difficulty? Williams and Colomb accordingly coach their students in a style of writing assimilated to a model of reading.

实用风格认为最重要的决定因素是读者，尤其是便于读者解读文本特征，特别是文本的话语特征。在这项决定因素上，实用风格如此坚定，以至它根本没有把它当作一种决定因素，而是一种必然结果：当然这种风格的卓越在于具备读者阅读时期望看到的语法特征。有人认为占用读者时间而不是为读者解决问题有别的原因吗？那么为什么除了告诉读者这个问题的解决方案还要写别的呢？ 除了组织文本帮助读者被困难吓倒之前搞清楚问题，还可怎么做呢？ 相应地，Williams and Colomb教导他们的学生采用与阅读模式相通的写作风格。

Classic style makes similar pretenses in adopting the rather different stand that the writer counts equally with the reader, that both are fully engaged by the subject, competent, and alert, that of course the reader will be interested in what the writer has to say, and that of course the reader will recognize truth once it has been clearly presented.

古典风格虽采用一种相当不同的立场，认为作者与读者同等重要，但也有类似的假装：两者都很关注事物本身，且具备这样的能力并充分意识到这点：读者当然会对作者说的话感兴趣，一旦真相被清晰地呈现出来读者当然会认出它。

In the model scene of practical style, readers and writers hold standard job slots in existing institutions. The reader has no leisure and does not want surprises; the reader reads not for personal reasons but to accomplish a job. Accomplishing the job depends upon the communication of information, and practical style serves the purpose of keeping the information flowing efficiently through institutions. Since students will go on to such employment, they must be trained to write in practical style. The writer is not an individual writing to another individual but a job description writing to another job description. There is a job to do and practical style is the appropriate tool for doing it: the style is thus fundamentally optimistic, pragmatic, and utilitarian. The motive is the job; eternal and noncontingent truth is irrelevant except as it bears upon the performance of the job—even then its eternal and noncontingent nature is beside the point.

实用风格的典型场景是，读者与作者在现有规范中完成标准任务。读者没有闲暇也不想要惊喜；读者阅读不是出于个人原因，而是为了完成工作。完成工作取决于信息的交流，而实用风格则是通过规范保证信息高效流通。由于学生将继续这样的工作，他们必须接受培训，运用实用风格写作。作者不是一个个体写给另一个个体，而是一份工作描述写给另一份工作描述。有一项工作要做，实用风格正是促成它的恰当工具：因此实用风格的基本特点是乐观、实用和功利。写作的动机是完成工作;真相是否永恒和不可能无关紧要，除非它有助于完成工作——即使永恒和不可能的性质与此无关。

There is a surface mark of practical style as presented by Williams and Colomb that derives from its fundamental stand and distinguishes it sharply from classic style. If the reader always expects to find certain kinds of things in certain “discourse locations,” and the writer submits uniformly to those expectations, then the style permits skimming, because the cream is always in the same place. This can be highly useful in certain practical situations: if you are sitting at a desk and need to plow through forty-three memos, most of whose substance you already know, it will be a great help if you can rely upon the memos to present their main points in the expected places; then you can simply glance through and extract what you want.

实用风格的基本立场演化出来的表层特征，正如Williams and Colomb表现的那样，与古典风格截然不同。如果读者总是期待在某个特定的“话语位置”找到某种内容，作者迎合这种期望，那么这种风格就允许略读，因为要点总是出现在相同的地方。在某种实用情境非常有用：如果你坐在桌旁看43页备忘录，其中大部分的内容你都熟悉，如果备忘录在特定地方呈现要点，对你会很有帮助；那你只用浏览一通选取你需要的信息。

If you try to skim classic writing in this way, you run the risk of missing indispensable conceptual nuances or refinements. In the model scene of classic style, the classic reader is not pressed for time, distracted by jobs to do, or mired in routine. The classic reader is competent, sophisticated, quite able to handle surprises, and unimpressed with predictability. The surface mark of classic style that is most uncongenial to practical style can be picked out by what we will call the “last-third” test: once you have progressed a little way into a piece of writing, block out the last third of each sentence as you come to it, and imagine the standard things you might expect to occupy that position, based on what you have already read. If what in fact does occupy that position is routinely one of those standard and expected things, then the piece may be a paragon of practical writing but is unlikely to be classic. This is not because classic sentences reverse themselves at the end: once you see the end of a classic sentence, you will recognize that the sentence was true to its direction, but that does not make the sentence predictable, because it usually contains a conceptual refinement that is clear and simple as the truth but not a cliché and hence not predictable. Here are four passages that pass the last-third test beautifully; none of them is likely to occur in practical style:

如果你打算阅读古典风格文章时略读，你可能漏掉重要的概念差异或优化。古典风格的典型场景中，古典风格的读者的时间不会紧迫，被待完成的任务分心，或者陷入日常琐碎中。古典风格的读者优秀、有品位，能够接受惊喜，对预示无动于衷。古典风格与实用风格最不相同的表层特征，可通过“最后的三分之一”测试辨认出：当你进入阅读的一定阶段后，请蒙住每句话最后的三分之一部分，根据你已经阅读的内容想象那个位置可能出现的标准内容。如果那个位置的内容没有超出标准和预期的范围，那么这件作品可能是实用写作的典范，但不可能是古典风格。并非古典风格的句子最后推翻了自身：一旦你看到古典风格的句子的结尾，你会认识到句子与它的方向一致，但这并不能预测句子的走向，因为它通常包含不断优化的概念，呈现清晰简单的真相，但绝非陈词滥调，因此不可预测。 这里有四段精彩地通过了最后三分之一的测试; 他们中没有一个可能出现在实用的风格中：

Although a dirty campaign was widely predicted, for the most part the politicians contented themselves with insults and lies. (Julian Barnes on the 1992 British parliamentary elections)

虽然人们广泛预言有一场不公平的运动，但大多数政治家都满足于侮辱和谎言。 （朱利安巴恩斯1992年英国议会选举）

With peer pressure and whippings at school and at home, we were soon completely socialized and as happy as children anywhere. (Ruth Baer Lambach)

在同伴的压力以及学校家庭的鞭策下，我们很快就完全习惯社交，在任何地方都像孩子一样欢乐。 （露丝贝尔兰巴赫）

In the same year [1827] the United Kingdom, Russia and France decided to intervene to enforce an armistice “without however taking any part in the hostilities.” The allied fleet went to parley with the Turkish fleet anchored in Navarino Bay (Pylos) and ended up destroying it.

It is from this weighing of delights against their cost that the student eater (particularly if he is a student at the University of Paris) erects the scale of values that will serve him until he dies or has to reside in the Middle West for a long period. (A. J. Liebling)
