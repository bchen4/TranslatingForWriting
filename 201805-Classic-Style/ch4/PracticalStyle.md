Classic Style Is Not Practical Style古典风格不是实用风格
In the model scene behind practical style, the reader has a problem to solve, a decision to make, a ruling to hand down, an inquiry to conduct, a machine to design or repair—in short, a job to do. The reader’s need, not the writer’s desire to articulate something, initiates the writing. The writer’s job is to serve the reader’s immediate need by delivering timely materials. The motive can thus be almost anything productive of a need: greed, enterprise, competition, philanthropy. Since the reader is engaged in solving a problem, the reading is not an end in itself, it is instrumental to some other end. That is why, in this scene, the prime stylistic virtue is ease of parsing. In practical style, the best presentation will allow the reader to acquire timely information with a minimum of distraction because, in this scene, writing is an instrument for delivering information with maximum efficiency and in such a way as to place the smallest possible burden upon the reader, who has other—more important—burdens to bear.

实用风格典型的应用场景是，读者要解决一个问题、做出一个决定、宣布一项裁决、开展一项调查、设计或修理一台机器，总之要做一项任务。正是读者的需要——而非作者表达的欲望——激发了写作。作者的任务，是提供合适的材料，以满足读者的迫切需求。因此动机几乎是任何引发需求的东西：贪婪、上进、竞争、慈善。因为读者要解决问题，所以阅读本身不是目的，阅读是为了达到其他目的。这就是为什么这种场景的主要风格特点，是易于解读。对实用风格来讲，最好的呈现，是让读者最快地获取信息且尽量减少干扰，因为这种场景的写作，是一种高效传达信息的工具，同时尽可能减少读者的负担，帮助他们完成更重要的任务。

In classic style, by contrast, neither writer nor reader has a job, the writing and reading do not serve a practical goal, and the writer has all the time in the world to present her subject as something interesting for its own sake. Her characteristic brevity comes from the elegance of her mind, never from pressures of time or employment. The writing is initiated by the writer, not the reader: the writer wants to present something not to a client, but to an indefinite audience, treated as if it were a single individual. Her motive is to present truth, not so that someone can use it to accomplish a practical goal, although someone might make use of it for such a purpose, but for its own sake.

相反，古典风格的作者和读者都没有任务在身，写作和阅读不用服务于某个实用目的，作者有充分的时间呈现她的话题，只为话题本身的趣味。她标志性的简洁源于思想的优雅，从不受迫于时间和雇主。写作由作者而非读者发起：作者呈现的受众不是客户，而是不确定的读者，这些不确定的读者都被当作单独的个体读者。她的动机是呈现真相，而不是帮助某人达到实用目的，虽然某人可能把它用于这样的目的，但也是为了真相本身。

Classic style and practical style have important areas of overlap; both styles place a high value on clarity and directness. Classic style values clarity because it sees itself as a transparent medium for the presentation of truth. Practical style values clarity because it places a premium on being easy to parse. Both styles can be described as precise and efficient, but for quite different reasons: practical style is precise and efficient because the reader wants to understand well and quickly for the purpose of making immediate use of what he is reading; classic style is precise and efficient because precision serves truth and because efficiency is a refinement. The efficiency of classic style is a sign of its having the leisure and luxury to afford refinement: the writer and reader have had all the time needed to train their minds to the requisite concert pitch.

古典风格和实用风格有重要的相同点：两种风格都注重清晰直接。古典风格的清晰，在于它把自己看成一种呈现真相的透明媒介。实用风格的清晰在于容易解读。两种风格都说得上准确和高效，但原因甚为不同：实用风格准确高效，是因为读者想快速准确地理解阅读内容，以便立即运用；古典风格准确高效，是因为准确才能表达真相，精炼之后必然高效。古典风格的高效，说明它有足够的闲暇和安逸慢慢精炼：作者和读者均有充分的时间，来训练他们的思想以满足必要的效率。

Neither classic style nor practical style contains much of the sort of internal network of cross-references that linguists call “metadiscourse” (“I would like to tell you about X but first I have to tell you about y”). In classic style, such explicit acknowledgment of planning defeats the immediacy and spontaneity that mark the style’s model scene, conversation. In practical style, a network of cross-references, clotting the text, is a poor substitute for less distracting indications of coherence.

古典风格和实用风格都没有太多文内的交叉引用，语言学家将之称作“元话语”（我想和你讲讲这个话题，但在此之前我要先讲讲那个话题）。古典风格认为，如此直白地承认语言经过事先谋划，破坏了古典风格的典型场景——即时自发的对话。在实用风格中，交叉引用会使文本瘀堵不畅，分散读者注意力，是流畅连贯的拙劣替代品。

There are a few recognizable prototypes of the model scene of practical style. The first, drawn from the world of corporate business or the legal profession, is a memorandum to a superior who has asked for information. The writer knows more about the subject than the reader, but it is the reader who will make a decision or take action, and so stands in need of some of the writer’s knowledge. The reader’s need is the motive for writing. A second prototype is a memorandum to a subordinate whose activities the superior is trying to direct and manage. In neither case does the reader want or expect to know everything the writer knows about the subject. Practical style is selective in a way that classic style is not. The cast is hierarchical, not symmetric. Clustered around these prototypes are recognizable extensions: the manual telling someone how to perform routine jobs; the manual telling someone how to use something; the how-to book instructing the CEO in the art of negotiation; the book about financial planning telling those with discretionary income how to invest it; the advisory from a manufacturer to owners of the manufactured product telling them that it has a defect and how to get it fixed.

实用风格的典型场景有一些常见的原型。第一种是源自公司业务人士或法律人士的备忘录，他们的上级需要他们提供信息。作者知道的信息比读者多，但读者是决策人或执行人，所以需要部分作者的知识。读者的需求是写作的动机。第二种原型是上级向下属写备忘录指导和管理其活动。在这两类场合中，读者不想也不打算从作者那了解某话题的全部信息。实用风格有所选择，但古典风格没有这种选择。实用风格的读者和作者有层级划分，并非对等。这些原型衍生了很多相关常见类型：常规工作执行手册；物品使用手册；CEO谈判艺术入门指南；自主支配收入投资理财书；制造品厂商向用户提供的维修手册。

Another prototype of this scene is the delivery of the results of research to fellow researchers, which is to say, fellow insiders. The writer knows more about his own research than the readers do, but they are fellow professionals who expect to know everything he knows as a result of reading his report, or know at least what they need to know for their own purposes. What is reported will affect their own independent activities in ways that they alone can judge. The writer is imparting information and does not want his writing, as such, to be noticed; it should fulfill every standard expectation and be as easy to parse as possible.

这种场景的另一个原型是向研究伙伴（也就是业内知情人）发布研究结果，作者对自己的研究了解得比读者多，但他们是业内专家，希望阅读报告后知道作者知道的一切，或者至少了解必要内容以达到各自目的。报告内容将影响他们各自独立的活动，且他们可自行决断这些活动。作者只是传达信息，并不想读者关注他的写作；它应该与读者的标准预期完全一致，且尽可能容易解读。

Most writing in schools and colleges is a perversion of practical style: the student pretends that he is writing a memorandum. He pretends that he knows more than the reader, that the reader needs this information, and that his job is to impart that information in a way that is easy for the reader to parse. This pretense is supposed to be practice for the real thing. Actually, the reader (the teacher) probably knows much more about the subject than the writer; the reader (the teacher) has no need whatever for the information; and the job of the writer is to cover himself from attack by his superior (the teacher). The actual scene interferes so much with the fantasy scene that the result is almost inevitably compromised, if not fraudulent.

大学及院校的大部分写作误用了实用风格：学生假装他在写备忘录。他假装知道的比读者多，读者需要他的信息，他的任务是是以读者易于解读的方式传达信息。这种假装本应是是为了练习实际内容。事实上，读者（老师）对一个话题的了解可能比作者要多很多；读者（老师）对信息毫无需求；作者的任务是是掩护自己以免受到上级（老师）的攻击。实际场景严重妨害了理想场景，写作的结果如果说不上欺骗，妥协几乎在所难免。

The best-known teachers of practical style are Strunk and White, in their ubiquitous Elements of Style. The best teachers of practical style are Joseph Williams and Gregory Colomb, in Williams’s Style: Toward Clarity and Grace and a series of academic articles and technical reports.

实用风格最知名的老师，是广泛流传的《风格的要素》的作者斯特伦克和怀特。实用风格最好的老师，是《风格：清晰、优雅地写作》的作者約瑟夫·威廉斯和格雷戈里·科伦；系列学术文章和技术报告也是优秀的实用风格范本。

Strunk and White’s disarming treatment of what everybody really needs to know about writing has been treasured by generations of people who are occasionally forced to write something and view the prospect with a sinking feeling of dread. As a guide to writing, The Elements of Style, being little more than an apparently arbitrary mixture of grammatical digest, handy list of common mistakes, and expert hand-holding, is drastically incomplete, but it is a masterpiece of psychological insight. Its attractions derive, we suspect, first, from its implicit, cheery, and optimistic promise that if you just read its few pages and work those few surface tricks it teaches you (“In summaries, keep to one tense,” “less should not be used for fewer”), you will not embarrass yourself; second, from its exhortatory cheerleading that seems so assured and upbeat; and third, from its tone of common sense that masks, at key points, an essential vacuousness: “Choose a suitable design and hold to it.”

关于每个人都该知道的写作，斯特伦克和怀特有深入人心的论述，几代人对此交口称赞，称赞的这些人偶尔被迫写些什么，且常为不知如何下笔担忧和沮丧。很明显，《风格的要素》只不过是语法选录、趁手的常见错误清单和专家解读的随意组合，非常不全面，但对读者心理把握很到位。我们推断它吸引人的地方表现在：第一，暗含积极乐观的允诺：只要你读上几页并运用它教你的几个表层技巧（“概述时，自始至终使用同一种时态”， “不要把形容可数名词的fewer误用为形容不可数名词的less”），你的写作就不会令你难堪；第二，人们坚定热情地推崇它的教诲；第三，关键之处，一些空洞的话被作者讲得跟常识一样，看起来很重要：“选定合适的文章构思,并尽力遵守。”

Such advice has the same immemorial power of “Just use your head, and you’ll be all right.” Advice of this sort has the great merit of being brief and supportive. There is a welcome assurance that there is really nothing to it, except for those truly mysterious aspects of the subject that cannot be taught at all. “I can teach you where to put a comma in ten minutes, but don’t expect me to teach you to write like Shakespeare.”

这种建议同“只要你动脑，就不会有错”一样，自古就有种魔力。它的优点是简洁、鼓舞人心。这是一种令人愉悦的自信：除了那些真正神秘不可教授的方面，写作真的没什么诀窍。“我可以用十分钟教你在哪里打逗号，但不要期待你能学会莎士比亚那样的写作。”

Williams and Colomb present an incomparably deeper and more orderly treatment of practical style. The style they present is consistent and mature; it makes decisions about all the major questions that define a style, and is fully developed. The claim behind Williams and Colomb’s treatment is large and theoretical: just as readers of an English sentence have expectations about word order and the distribution of information in a sentence, so readers of what Williams and Colomb call “pointed texts” have in their minds a grammar of such texts that tells them where to look for what. Readers will use that grammar. Writing that conforms to it will be easy for the reader to follow. Writing that resists it will be difficult for the reader to follow. For example, a reader looks for an opening section (“the issue”) and a following section (“the discussion”) within each unit of a pointed text. He looks for a rich lexical field, at the end of the issue, which will be used to weave the discussion together, to give it cohesion, as it progresses. He looks for a point at the end of the discussion. If there is a point at the end of the issue, it will be taken to be an adumbration of the point at the end of the discussion. Units of discourse nest, so that units within the discussion will themselves be composed of an issue and a discussion. These principles work themselves down to the level of the sentence, where the reader expects the first part of the sentence to present an issue (topic) and the second part of the sentence to present a discussion (comment). The reader expects old information in the sentence before new. The reader prefers to understand things in terms of actions and agents, so the backbone of a sentence should be a verb that conveys action, and the subject of such a verb should be one of the agents—perhaps metaphorical—in this action-story. Since readers link agents to actions in pairs, writers should try not to separate the subject (agent) from the verb (action) with distracting information. And so on.

威廉斯和科伦对实用风格的论述，不仅深刻且更有条理。他们呈现的风格连贯一致、成熟规范；实用风格对所有重大问题采取了自己立场，是发展完善的风格。威廉斯和科伦的论述主张涵盖范围广理论性强：读者阅读英文句子，对词序和信息分布有自己的预判，威廉斯和科伦称之为“指向性文本”，这类文本的读者在脑子里形成某种语法结构，知道在哪里寻找什么信息。读者阅读时常借助这种语法结构。写作符合这种语法结构则容易理解；反之就很难理解。比如，指向性文本的读者阅读每个单元时，会寻找对应的开头部分（“议题”）和后续部分（“讨论”）。议题结尾会逐步把讨论要点编入其中，将其融会贯通，读者可以在这部分找到丰富的词场。在讨论部分的末尾读者可寻找问题点。如果议题结尾提出了问题，那么可以预判讨论部分的结尾可能回应这个问题。话语单元是一种嵌套模式，讨论部分也由问题单元和讨论单元构成。句子层面也遵守这样的原则，读者期待句子的第一部分是问题（话题），第二部分是讨论（评论）。读者希望先看到熟悉信息，再看到新信息。读者倾向于根据动作和动作执行者理解事情，因此，句子的骨干应该是一个表达动作的动词，该动词的主语处在一组动作故事中，有一个对应的动作执行者——或许是比喻性的。由于读者将动作执行者与动作连成一对，作者应该尽量避免主语（动作执行者）与动词（动作）被其它干扰信息隔断。如此之类还有很多。

Williams and Colomb’s finely detailed treatment of practical style provides an indispensable guide impressive in its scope and intelligence. It is missing just one thing, namely, an explicit acknowledgment of its fundamental stand, and an acknowledgment that its fundamental stand is one of many alternatives. While their work is thorough, systematic, and theoretically sophisticated, and while they know that they are dealing with just one style, the work is misleading in its self-presentation: it pretends that the style it concerns, and about which it gives excellent advice, is universal and exclusive rather than merely ubiquitous. Practical style rests on a set of answers to basic questions; other styles rest on different answers to those same questions.

威廉斯和科伦对实用风格的细致论述，是必不可少的指导教材，其范围之广和智慧之高深令人折服。唯一的纰漏是，他们没有直言不讳它的基本立场，以及它的基本立场只是众多选择之一。虽然他们的作品论述详实、体系完整、理论成熟，作者也知道他们论述的是一种具体风格，但作品在自我呈现方面误导了读者：它假装实用风格无与伦比，适用于任何场景，除此以外别无其他行文风格，而不只是到处皆可见。实用风格之本质是它对于一系列基本问题的回答; 对于同样的问题，其它风格有不同的回答。

Practical style comes from deciding that what matters in style is the reader, and in particular the reader’s ease in parsing features of the text, especially the discourse features of the text. Practical style is so firm in this decision that it treats it as no decision at all, but as a necessity: of course excellence of style consists in conforming to the reader’s grammatical expectations in the act of reading. Why else would anyone presume to take up a reader’s time than to solve a problem for the reader? Why then would anyone write except to inform the reader about a solution to that problem? How else can this be done aside from ordering the text so that readers can get the point before giving up in the face of the obvious difficulty? Williams and Colomb accordingly coach their students in a style of writing assimilated to a model of reading.

风格中最重要的是读者，尤其是其文本特征要便于读者解读——特别是文本的话语特征，这个决定成就了实用风格。实用风格对这个决定确信无疑，以至它从根本上认为这不是一项决定，而是一种必然结果：成功的风格，其语法特征符合读者阅读的期望。为什么有人担心占用读者时间而不认为自己在为读者解决问题？为什么告诉读者问题的解决方案之外还要写别的？要避免读者被显然的困难吓倒，帮助他尽早抓住要点，除了组织文本还可做什么？对此，威廉斯和科伦的训练方法是让学生参照读者的阅读模式开展写作。

Classic style makes similar pretenses in adopting the rather different stand that the writer counts equally with the reader, that both are fully engaged by the subject, competent, and alert, that of course the reader will be interested in what the writer has to say, and that of course the reader will recognize truth once it has been clearly presented.

古典风格的立场虽然不太相同，但有类似的假装：作者与读者同等重要；两者都关注且胜任这个话题，并全心投入；读者当然会对作者说的话感兴趣；一旦真相被清晰地呈现出来读者当然会看到它。

In the model scene of practical style, readers and writers hold standard job slots in existing institutions. The reader has no leisure and does not want surprises; the reader reads not for personal reasons but to accomplish a job. Accomplishing the job depends upon the communication of information, and practical style serves the purpose of keeping the information flowing efficiently through institutions. Since students will go on to such employment, they must be trained to write in practical style. The writer is not an individual writing to another individual but a job description writing to another job description. There is a job to do and practical style is the appropriate tool for doing it: the style is thus fundamentally optimistic, pragmatic, and utilitarian. The motive is the job; eternal and noncontingent truth is irrelevant except as it bears upon the performance of the job—even then its eternal and noncontingent nature is beside the point.

读者与作者按照既定的规范完成标准任务，是实用风格的典型场景。读者没有闲暇，也不想要惊喜；读者阅读不是为了个人原因，而是为了完成任务。交流信息才能确保任务完成，而实用风格的作用是在规范中保障信息高效流通。由于学生将继续这样的职业，他们必须接受培训，运用实用风格写作。作者的写作不是个体与个体的交流，而是工作描述与工作描述的交流。有一项任务要做，实用风格正是完成它的有利工具：因此实用风格的基本特点是乐观、实用和功利。写作的动机是完成任务; 真相的永恒和必然无关紧要，除非它关系到任务实践——即使那样，它永恒和必然的性质不因是否相关而改变。

There is a surface mark of practical style as presented by Williams and Colomb that derives from its fundamental stand and distinguishes it sharply from classic style. If the reader always expects to find certain kinds of things in certain “discourse locations,” and the writer submits uniformly to those expectations, then the style permits skimming, because the cream is always in the same place. This can be highly useful in certain practical situations: if you are sitting at a desk and need to plow through forty-three memos, most of whose substance you already know, it will be a great help if you can rely upon the memos to present their main points in the expected places; then you can simply glance through and extract what you want.

威廉斯和科伦提出的表层特征，源自实用风格的基本立场，与古典风格截然不同。如果读者总是期待在某些“话语位置”找到相应信息，作者也满足这些期望，那么这种风格就允许略读，因为要点总是在相同的地方。这对一些实用场合非常适用：如果你坐在桌前，需要看一份43页的备忘录，其中大部分的内容你都知道，如果看备忘录特定部分能找到要点，对你帮助就很大；这样你只用浏览一遍，就能选取你需要的信息。

If you try to skim classic writing in this way, you run the risk of missing indispensable conceptual nuances or refinements. In the model scene of classic style, the classic reader is not pressed for time, distracted by jobs to do, or mired in routine. The classic reader is competent, sophisticated, quite able to handle surprises, and unimpressed with predictability. The surface mark of classic style that is most uncongenial to practical style can be picked out by what we will call the “last-third” test: once you have progressed a little way into a piece of writing, block out the last third of each sentence as you come to it, and imagine the standard things you might expect to occupy that position, based on what you have already read. If what in fact does occupy that position is routinely one of those standard and expected things, then the piece may be a paragon of practical writing but is unlikely to be classic. This is not because classic sentences reverse themselves at the end: once you see the end of a classic sentence, you will recognize that the sentence was true to its direction, but that does not make the sentence predictable, because it usually contains a conceptual refinement that is clear and simple as the truth but not a cliché and hence not predictable. Here are four passages that pass the last-third test beautifully; none of them is likely to occur in practical style:

如果你打算以跳读的方式阅读古典风格的文章，你可能会忽略概念的细微差异或层层推进。古典风格的典型场景是，古典风格的读者不会受限于时间，不会因任务没完成而分心，也不会陷入日常琐碎中。古典风格的读者有能力、见多识广，能够应对惊喜，对可预见的东西不感兴趣。我们称之为“最后三分之一”的测试，可以挑出古典风格与实用风格最不同的表层特征：如果一篇文章你已经读了一部分，接下来每读一句话，你就蒙住最后三分之一部分，根据已经阅读的内容，想象那个位置可能出现的标准内容，如果总是和标准和预期一致，那这件作品可能是实用写作的典范，但不可能是古典风格。并非古典风格的句子最后推翻了自己的逻辑：对于古典风格的文章，一旦你读到句子结尾，你会发现句子未曾偏离方向，但句子不会因此变得可预测，因为它的概念不断完善，直到呈现清晰简单的真相，但没有任何陈词滥调，因此不可预测。下面四段话完美通过最后三分之一的测试；没有一个是实用风格：
