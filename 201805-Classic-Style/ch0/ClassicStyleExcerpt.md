# 古典风格选段一

> You imagine what you desire; you will what you imagine; and at last, you create what you will.

> 你想象你所渴望之物；你执意你所想象之物；最后，你创造你所执意之物。

—Bernard Shaw, the serpent speaking to Eve in Back to Methuselah

—出自萧伯纳的剧作《回到玛士撒拉时代》，蛇对夏娃说的话


The thought expressed in this passage has three steps. They are schematically identical. In each, an activity is located and then linked to its source in a different activity. There is a sentence expressing each step. Each of these sentences inherits the schematic structure of the thought, as in “You imagine what you desire.” Paired activities are expressed as paired clauses—“you imagine” and “you desire”—and the conceptual link between paired activities is mirrored in the linguistic link between paired clauses.

这个段落表达的思想分成三步，三步的图式结构完全相同。每一步建立一项活动，然后将它连向它的起点，该起点又出现在另一项不同的活动中。每一步有对应的一句话表达。每句话保留了思想的图式结构，比如“你想象你所渴望之物”这句话。成对的活动表现为成对的从句——“你想象”和“你渴望”——成对活动的概念关系反映在成对从句的语言关系中。

These three steps are not independent, but are ordered as a temporal sequence in which the product of one step serves as the source of the next. The grammatical structure mirrors this conceptual sequence: three sentences of the same grammatical form occur in linear order; the clause referring to the product in one sentence serves to refer to the source in the next.

这三步并非相互独立，而是按时间顺序排列：一个步骤建立的活动是下一个步骤的起点。段落的语法结构反映了这种概念顺序：三个句子语法形式相同，线性排列；从句既指称一个句子表达的活动，也指称下一个句子表达的起点。

Shaw’s passage—with its precise and detailed combination of schematic images—is the result of conceptual and linguistic work, but the work is not exhibited. Reading the sentence is like watching a champion gymnast perform a routine on the parallel bars. Obviously the gymnastic performance is the result of previous work, but only the achievement is exhibited.

萧伯纳的这段话——图式意象组合既精确又细致——正是概念分析和遣词造句的结果，然而它们的过程并没有展现出来。阅读这些句子犹如观看一位体操冠军表演一套双杠动作。显然，这套体操表演是先前训练的结果，但只展现了成果。

The achievement is final. In the classic view, thought comes first and language is sufficient to express it. Any problem of expression has an exact solution in the language, and this solution, once found, will appear to be obvious, perfect, and definitive. The writer knows when he has finished revising.

成果才是最终要表现的东西。古典视角认为思想先行，语言足以表达思想。任何表达问题都可以在语言中找到恰到好处的解决方案,一旦找到这种解决方案，它看起来如此理所当然、完美无瑕、不可动摇。作家知道什么时候才不用再修改了。

Perfection of phrasing in classic style is assumed to follow from precision of preceding thought. The classic writer draws precise conceptual distinctions and locates exact conceptual relations until the analysis is finished. He then expresses the result of this analysis. Its schematic conceptual structure is mirrored in the schematic linguistic structure. Often, the result appears to be something like a mathematical formulation.

人们认为古典风格措辞完美是因为先行思想足够准确。古典风格的作家如要准确把握概念差异和概念关系，需完成全部分析。然后他才把这种分析的结果表达出来，它的概念图式结构体现在语言图式结构中。通常，表达结果呈现出某种形态，类似数学公式。

In classic style, the goal of analysis is truth in its most efficient form consistent with accuracy. Expression, carrying the elegance that comes from `compressed energy`, is like a perfectly tuned stringed instrument: the strings are taut to exact degrees to correspond to exact pitches that stand in exact relations to one another. The pitches and their relations exist before the strings are tuned. Each string is tuned to a pitch and the results are judged by comparison to this pre-existing reality. A musician tuning an instrument is not finished until everything is exactly right, but once it is exactly right, there is simply nothing left to do.

古典风格的分析目标是用最高效的形式确保事实足够准确。表达因言简义丰而优雅，好比一件完美调弦的乐器：每根琴弦紧绷到特定程度，对应特定的音调，确立音调间彼此的关系。琴弦的音调和彼此的关系在调弦之前就已存在。每根琴弦调试到各自音调后，评判演奏结果只需比较这预先存在的事实。音乐家调试琴弦，全部都对上才算完成，一旦对了，也就没什么可做的了。

Similarly, in the classic view, the thought exists before the expression, and the expression is judged by comparing it with the pre-existing thought. In writing a sentence, a writer knows when he has it exactly right, after which there is nothing left to do.

类似地，古典视角认为思想存在于表达之前，评判表达的结果需将其与预先存在的思想进行比较。作家写下一个句子，知道什么时候足够准确，之后就没什么可做的了。

Shaw’s sentence knows when to stop because it expresses a complete analysis. It might be contrasted with the following passage—written by an editor for the influential journal he edits—which isn’t over even when it is over.

萧伯纳的句子因表达出完整的分析能适时结束。与之比较的是下面这个段落——由一本有影响力的杂志的编辑执笔——虽然结束但没有完成。

> The concept of spatial form has unquestionably been central to modern criticism not only of literature but of the fine arts and of language and of culture in general. Indeed, the consistent goal of the natural and human sciences in the twentieth century has been the discovery and/or construction of synchronic structural models to account for concrete phenomena.

> 空间形式的概念无疑对现代批评极为重要，不仅是文学批评，通常还有美术批评、语言批评和文化批评。事实上，20世纪的自然科学和人文科学持之以恒的目标是发现和（或）构建解释具体现象的共时结构模式。

Classic style is not exclusive. A writer’s position or status cannot make her a classic writer, or bar her from becoming a classic writer. An undergraduate at a junior college wrote the following classic passage in her discussion of the spatial form of Rembrandt’s Old Man with a Gold Chain:

古典风格不是某类群体的专属。一个作家的职务或身份无法使其成为一名古典风格的作家，也不能阻碍其成为一名古典风格的作家。一个大专本科生在讨论伦勃朗《戴金项链的老者》这幅画的空间形式时写下下面这段古典风格的段落：

> Rembrandt was a very young man when he painted this picture, but it is a work demonstrating the insight and wisdom of an older man. It is a poignant picture and painful to look upon because it is not just a painting of a man, but an expression of mortality.

> 伦勃朗画这幅画时还是一位非常年轻的小伙子，但这幅画体现的洞见和智慧犹如来自一位更年长的人。这是一幅悲楚的画，看着令人痛苦，因为他不仅是一个人的画像，也是一种对死亡的表达。
