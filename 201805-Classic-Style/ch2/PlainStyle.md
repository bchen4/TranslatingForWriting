# Classic Style Is Not Plain Style
# 古典风格不是平实风格

Plain style is communal, its model scene a congregation in which speakers reaffirm for each other common truths that are the property of all. In the theology behind plain style, truth is always simple, and it is a common human possession. Individual revisions of this communal possession distort and dilute it. The wisdom of children can be the wisdom of adults, because knowing truth requires no special experience and no critical analysis. Sophisticated thought and conceptual refinement pervert truth. Any language that reaches beyond the simplest level is suspicious as the probable symptom of such a perversion. Simple language may not always be completely adequate to the expression of truth, but at least it is pure as far as it goes.

平实风格是群体风格，典型的应用场景是教堂集会，演讲者向彼此确认大家都能拥有的普遍真相。平实风格背后的神学认为真相总是很简单，能被人们共同拥有。个体的修改将歪曲和削弱真相。获取真相不需要特别的经验和批判性分析，孩子的智慧即大人的智慧。复杂的思想和完善的逻辑反倒会歪曲真相。任何语言一旦超出最简单水平，都有必要怀疑它可能会曲解真相。简单语言也许无法每次完全表达出真相，但至少纯粹至极。

Classic style does not reject plain style, although it rejects the theology behind it and sees that theology as illegitimately elevating a necessary foundation into an achieved style. From the perspective of classic style, plain style is deficient because the theology behind plain style ignores the fact that, left to themselves, people are vulnerable to special interests and prone to special pleading. People are weak, and common wisdom is thus often self-serving. It is perfectly possible for common wisdom to be an anthology of a community’s complacent errors, because common wisdom does not include any principle of critical validation. Without critical testing, common wisdom becomes received opinion.

古典风格并不排斥平实风格，尽管不认同它背后的神学理论，古典风格认为平实本是一种必要的基础，却被错误地提升到风格层次。从古典风格的视角来看，平实风格的缺陷在于，它背后的神学理论忽视了这个事实：如果人们没有约束，人们容易委身于特殊利益和特殊诉求。人是软弱的，群体智慧常常是利己的。群体自鸣得意的共同智慧，很有可能是共同的缺陷，因为共同智慧没有任何批判性验证的准则。群体智慧即使未经批判性验证，也会被普遍接受。

Classic style views itself as repairing the deficiency of plain style by introducing sophistication and individual responsibility. First, classic writers and readers are an elite community, consisting of those who practice the critical discipline of its theology. Anyone can take up this practice and so join, but the style is aristocratic, not egalitarian. Second, classic wisdom cannot be the wisdom of children because it depends upon a wealth of adult experience. In plain style, everyone is equal; truth is everyone’s birthright. It is seen by all; it is everyone’s possession. It can come out of the mouths of babes. In classic style, truth is available to all who are willing to work to achieve it, but truth is certainly not commonly possessed by all and is no one’s birthright. In the classic view, truth is the possession of individuals who have validated common wisdom; for them, truth has been achieved, and such achievement requires both experience and a critical intelligence beyond the range of babes.

古典风格凭借深思熟虑和作者的负责，来修正平实风格的缺陷。首先，古典风格的作者和读者属于精英群体，他们是一群对神学进行批判性分析的人。任何人都可以接受并加入这种批判性分析，但古典风格并非平民风格，而是贵族风格。其次，小孩不可能拥有古典风格的智慧，因为它需要丰富的成人经验。平实风格认为每个人都是平等的；获取真相是每个人与生俱来的权利。所有人都能看到真相；所有人都能拥有真相；真相甚至可以从婴儿的嘴里说出来。在古典风格中，真相属于所有愿意努力争取它的人，并非所有人共同拥有，也不是任何人与生俱来的权利。古典风格认为，真相属于那些验证过群体智慧的个体；对他们来说，真相已掌握，而获取真相需要的经验和批判智慧，婴儿是无法拥有的。

Classic style remedies the deficiency of plain style by requiring the writer to stand entirely behind the thought she presents. Freshness is mandatory in classic style but freshness has nothing to do with novelty of ideas, on which classic style places no special premium. It is rather the requirement that the thinking behind the writing be the achievement of an individual. The classic writer has done the thinking, personally. Even when she accepts or uses a commonplace, she has thought it through herself and can stand behind it herself.

为了弥补平实风格的不足，古典风格要求作者为她所呈现的思想负责到底。古典风格要求新颖，但新颖不是创造新想法，古典风格并不看重这一点。古典风格需要个体为写作贡献思想。古典风格作者以身作则，践行这个思考过程。即使她采纳的或使用的观点司空见惯，她自己已充分思考过，并且会为它负责。

Classic style contains plain style concretely by incorporating it, but also by extending it, the way a Chinese ideogram contains a radical. A classic sentence is often a nuanced version of a sentence that otherwise might have been plain. “Grace is simple” is plain. “Grace, from the perspective of God, is simple” is classic, as is “The machinery of grace is always simple.” Plain style values simplicity but shuns nuance. Classic style values both simplicity and nuance. “The truth is pure and simple” is plain. “The truth is rarely pure, and never simple” is classic. “Seeing is believing” is plain. “Seeing is believing only if you don’t see too clearly” is classic.

古典风格与平实风格是一种具体的包含关系，前者对后者既有兼容也有延伸，就像中国的表意汉字与偏旁部首的包含关系。通常平实风格的句子经细微修改后，便成了古典风格。“优雅就是简单”是平实风格。“在上帝眼里，优雅就是简单”是古典风格，“优雅的自行车架总是简单的”[ 出自迈克尔·多纳希，《机器》，收录于《习俗》，牛津大学出版社，1988，第1页]同样是古典风格。平实风格注重简单，但忽视了细微差别。古典风格既简单又微妙。“真相纯粹且简单”是平实风格。“真相难得纯粹，却从未简单”是古典风格。“眼见为实”是平实风格。“只有你看不太清楚时，眼见才为实”是古典风格。
