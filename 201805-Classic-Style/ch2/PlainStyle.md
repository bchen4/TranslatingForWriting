# Classic Style Is Not Plain Style
# 古典风格不是平易风格

Plain style is communal, its model scene a congregation in which speakers reaffirm for each other common truths that are the property of all. In the theology behind plain style, truth is always simple, and it is a common human possession. Individual revisions of this communal possession distort and dilute it. The wisdom of children can be the wisdom of adults, because knowing truth requires no special experience and no critical analysis. Sophisticated thought and conceptual refinement pervert truth. Any language that reaches beyond the simplest level is suspicious as the probable symptom of such a perversion. Simple language may not always be completely adequate to the expression of truth, but at least it is pure as far as it goes.

平易风格归集体所有，它的典型场景是教堂集会，集会中的发言者相互重申共同的真相，这些真相属于所有人。平易风格背后的神学认为真相总是很简单，并且为人类普遍拥有。个人如果修改这种集体所有物，将使它歪曲和削弱。孩子的智慧可以成为大人的智慧，因为了解真相不需要特殊的经验和批判性分析。思想练达和概念完善将歪曲真相。任何超过最简单水平的语言都被疑似歪曲真相的可能征兆。简单的语言也许不能总是完全足以表达真相，但至少足够纯粹。

Classic style does not reject plain style, although it rejects the theology behind it and sees that theology as illegitimately elevating a necessary foundation into an achieved style. From the perspective of classic style, plain style is deficient because the theology behind plain style ignores the fact that, left to themselves, people are vulnerable to special interests and prone to special pleading. People are weak, and common wisdom is thus often self-serving. It is perfectly possible for common wisdom to be an anthology of a community’s complacent errors, because common wisdom does not include any principle of critical validation. Without critical testing, common wisdom becomes received opinion.

古典风格并不排斥平易风格，尽管不认同它背后的神学，认为这种神学不正当地将一种必要的基础上升到一种完全的风格。从古典风格的角度来看，平易风格存在缺陷是因为平易风格背后的神学忽视了这样一个事实：任由他们自己选择，人们容易屈服于特殊利益和特殊诉求。人是软弱的，而集体智慧常常为己谋利。集体智慧完全有可能只是集结了群体自鸣得意的错误，因为集体智慧不包括任何批评性验证的原则。即使未经过批判性验证，集体智慧也会成为大家普遍接受的观点。

Classic style views itself as repairing the deficiency of plain style by introducing sophistication and individual responsibility. First, classic writers and readers are an elite community, consisting of those who practice the critical discipline of its theology. Anyone can take up this practice and so join, but the style is aristocratic, not egalitarian. Second, classic wisdom cannot be the wisdom of children because it depends upon a wealth of adult experience. In plain style, everyone is equal; truth is everyone’s birthright. It is seen by all; it is everyone’s possession. It can come out of the mouths of babes. In classic style, truth is available to all who are willing to work to achieve it, but truth is certainly not commonly possessed by all and is no one’s birthright. In the classic view, truth is the possession of individuals who have validated common wisdom; for them, truth has been achieved, and such achievement requires both experience and a critical intelligence beyond the range of babes.

古典风格讲究练达和个体责任，恰恰修复了平易风格的缺陷。首先，古典风格的作家和读者属于精英群体，他们对它的神学采取批判性方法。任何人都可以接受这种方式并加入其中，但古典风格是贵族风格，不是平民风格。其次，古典风格的智慧不可能是孩子的智慧，因为它取决于丰富的成人经验。平易风格把每个人当作平等的；真相是每个人天生的权利。所有人都能看到真相；所有人都能拥有真相。它可以从婴儿的口里说出来。而古典风格，所有愿意努力实现它的人都可以获得真相，但真相并非所有人共同拥有，也不是任何人与生俱来的权利。古典风格认为真相属于已经验证过集体智慧的个人；对他们来说，真相已经实现，而这种实现既需要经验，也需要婴儿无法拥有的批判智慧。

Classic style remedies the deficiency of plain style by requiring the writer to stand entirely behind the thought she presents. Freshness is mandatory in classic style but freshness has nothing to do with novelty of ideas, on which classic style places no special premium. It is rather the requirement that the thinking behind the writing be the achievement of an individual. The classic writer has done the thinking, personally. Even when she accepts or uses a commonplace, she has thought it through herself and can stand behind it herself.

古典风格要求作者为他所呈现的思想负责到底，因此弥补了平易风格的不足。新颖是古典风格的要求，但新颖无关想法的创新，古典风格并不看重这一点。个人成就源于写作背后的思想才是古典风格的要求。古典风格作家亲自践行了这个思考过程。即使她接受或使用老生常谈的东西，她自己对此进行了完全的思考且能提供足够的支持。

Classic style contains plain style concretely by incorporating it, but also by extending it, the way a Chinese ideogram contains a radical. A classic sentence is often a nuanced version of a sentence that otherwise might have been plain. “Grace is simple” is plain. “Grace, from the perspective of God, is simple” is classic, as is “The machinery of grace is always simple.” Plain style values simplicity but shuns nuance. Classic style values both simplicity and nuance. “The truth is pure and simple” is plain. “The truth is rarely pure, and never simple” is classic. “Seeing is believing” is plain. “Seeing is believing only if you don’t see too clearly” is classic.

古典风格具体地包含了平易风格，不仅将其纳入其中，而且有所延伸，这种方式就像中国的表意汉字包含着偏旁部首。古典风格的句子往往是平易风格的句子经细微改动后的版本。“优雅很简单”是平易风格。“以上帝的视角，优雅很简单”是古典风格，“优雅的机制很简单”同是古典风格。平易风格注重简单但是回避了细微差别。古典风格既简单又微妙。“真相纯粹且简单”是平易风格。“真相难得纯粹难得简单”是古典风格。“眼见为实”是平易风格。“只有当你看不太清楚的时候，眼见才为实”是古典风格。
