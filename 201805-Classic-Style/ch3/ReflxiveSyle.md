# Classic Style Is Not Reflexive Style
# 古典风格不是反思风格

In the classic stand on presentation, writing is a perfectly transparent window through which a subject is presented; the ability of the writer and the sufficiency of the language to serve this presentation are never in doubt.

古典风格对呈现的立场是，写作是一面完美透明的窗户，事物透过这面窗被呈现出来；毋庸置疑，作者有呈现的能力，语言亦足以服务呈现。

This fundamental stand opposes classic style irreconcilably to an entire family of styles in which the writing itself shares a focus with any other possible subject, and the difficulties of the writing are brought to the reader’s attention.

这个基本立场，使古典风格与这样一组风格截然相反：写作自身同一些其它可能的话题糅杂一起，写作的困难被带到读者面前。

Classic writing can present anything, but even when the subject presented is writing itself, the focus is not shared. La Bruyère talks about the conditions of good writing when he says, “It is necessary to express what is true in order to write naturally, powerfully, sensitively,” but he does not call attention to his own writing as he is doing so. When Alexander Pope criticizes bad verse in An Essay on Criticism, the writing itself imitates the faults he discusses, becoming a focus of the reader’s attention: “And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line.” Classic style is a performance style, and while classic writers can be skeptical about anything else, they cannot be skeptical about their own ability to perform when they are in the act of performing. The classic writer assumes that his subject can be known and can be expressed without distortion. These are enabling conventions of the style. The classic writer is not necessarily free of doubts about his enterprise, but as a performer he must appear to be. An acrobat, a concert pianist, an actor cannot simultaneously perform and question the possibility of performing. Classic style is a style for performance, not a style for questioning its own competence.

古典风格可以呈现任何事物，哪怕呈现的就是写作本身，读者也不会注意到写作过程。拉布吕耶尔谈到造就佳作的条件时说，“写作要想自然、有力、生动，必须表达出真相”[ 出自拉布吕耶尔，《品格论》，1688，编辑：罗伯特·格拉鹏，巴黎，Garnier 出版社，1962，第70页] ，他谈论的是写作，但没有让读者注意到他自己的写作。亚历山大·蒲柏在《论批评》中批判拙劣的韵文时，通过模仿这种拙劣，使读者注意到写作本身：“十四个低调词汇爬上沉闷的线条”[ 出自亚历山大·蒲柏，《论批评》，1711，收录于《亚历山大·蒲柏诗集》，编辑：约翰·布特，耶鲁大学出版社，1963，第154页，第347行]。古典风格是一种表演风格，表演时古典风格作家可能会怀疑任何其它事情，唯独不能怀疑自身的表演能力。古典风格的作家断定他要呈现的事物可以被理解，且表达不会使其被曲解。这些是古典风格约定俗成的条件。古典风格的作家并不一定对他的写作确凿无疑，但作为一名表演者，他必须表现成这样。杂技师、钢琴演奏家、演员不能在表演的同时还质疑表演的可能性。古典风格是一种表演风格，不是一种自我怀疑的风格。

When we open a cookbook, we completely put aside—and expect the author to put aside—the kind of question that leads to the heart of certain philosophic and religious traditions. Is it possible to talk about cooking? Do eggs really exist? Is food something about which knowledge is possible? Can anyone else ever tell us anything true about cooking? These questions may lead to enlightenment or to satori; they do not lead to satisfying dinners. Readers of cookbooks expect to see cooking treated directly, as if such metaphysical and epistemological questions could never be entertained by anyone, even though we know they can be and have been entertained by saints and sages. We do not expect the writer to be immobilized by preliminary discussions of whether it is possible to talk about “cooking,” if such a thing even exists. Classic style similarly puts aside as inappropriate philosophical questions about its enterprise. If it took those questions up, it could never get around to treating its subject, and its purpose is exclusively to treat its subject.

当我们打开一本讲烹饪的书，我们完全不会考虑到——也不会期待作者考虑到——那种导向某种关键的哲学和宗教传统的问题。烹饪可能被谈论吗？鸡蛋真的存在吗？食物可能用知识来解释吗？有任何其他人能告诉我们烹饪的真谛吗？这些问题可能给人启示或顿悟，但无法教我们做出满意的晚餐。烹饪书籍的读者希望看到的，是直接讲烹饪的东西，理所当然不会考虑这种抽象的认识论问题，虽然我们知道圣贤人士会考虑它们。如果开头就讨论“烹饪”是否可能被谈论——即使存在这样的问题——作者很可能无法继续写下去。与此类似，古典风格写作不会考虑不合时宜的哲学问题。如果讨论这些问题，古典风格可能无暇论述它的话题，而专门论述它的话题才是它的的目的。

Raising skeptical doubts about the writer’s own enterprise is a feature of nonclassic self-conscious styles. In such styles, the writer’s chief, if unstated, concern is to escape being convicted of philosophical naïveté about his own enterprise. Such a writer is careful to gesture periodically toward the contingent frame of his own discourse, to disclaim any belief that his writing can treat any subject directly. The style stays in the foreground, inextricably mingled with its announced subject. It is marked with formulaic hedges concerning the possibility of knowledge, the contingency of knowledge, and the ability of language to express knowledge. “Impotence principles” such as the doctrine that discourse can never be about anything except itself share the focus of the writer’s attention with any possible subject.

自我意识强的非古典风格散文有个特点：作者会怀疑自己写的东西。这类风格的作者用哲学眼光，看待自己写的东西，避免让读者批评他太天真，这也成为了他考虑的主要问题。作者常常小心地解释可能的话语框架，否认他的写作可以直接处理任何话题。这种风格非常醒目，与其论述的话题糅杂一起难以区分，很少对知识的可能性、知识的偶然性，和语言表达知识的能力做正面答复。话语永远不可能谈论其本身以外的任何事物，诸如此类“无能原则”，使读者看到任何可能的话题，也会让读者看到作者的写作。

Classic prose does not discuss doubts or fears about its own enterprise, not because it is naïve, but because it has chosen something incompatible with reflexive inquiry. We can question the possibility of acting or we can act, but we cannot do both at once. Classic writers make an unspoken choice: they act. Rather than discuss the possibility of action, they put that possibility to the test, and let the reader be the judge.

古典散文不会讨论作者对其写下的东西的疑惑或担忧，不是因为它天真，而是因为它选择的，是与冥想探究对立的立场。我们可以怀疑行动的可行性，或者我们可以行动起来。古典风格的作家不言自明选择了行动。他们没有讨论行动是否可行，而是验证它的可行性，让读者自己来判断。

Clifford Geertz, in Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author, quotes an example of such a self-referential and self-questioning style from the introduction, “Self and Other,” to Loring Danforth’s The Death Rituals of Rural Greece:

克利福德·格尔茨在《论著与生活：作为作者的人类学家》一文中，从“自我与他人”的引言到洛林·丹福思的《希腊乡村的死亡仪式》引用了一个自我参照和自我质疑风格的例子：

> Anthropology inevitably involves an encounter with the Other. All too often, however, the ethnographic distance that separates the reader of anthropological texts and the anthropologist himself from the Other is rigidly maintained and at times even artificially exaggerated. In many cases this distancing leads to an exclusive focus on the Other as primitive, bizarre, and exotic. The gap between a familiar “we” and an exotic “they” is a major obstacle to a meaningful understanding of the Other, an obstacle that can only be overcome through some form of participation in the world of the Other. 

> 人类学必然会涉及与他人的相遇。然而，人种距离使人类学文本的读者、人类学家本人不同于其他人，这种距离常常维持在特定水平，有时甚至被人为地夸大。多数情况下，这种疏远专门把注意力引向原始、奇怪、外来的他人身上。熟悉的“我们”与外来的“他们”之间的差距，是深入了解他人的主要障碍，只有通过某种形式参与他人的世界才能克服这种障碍。

Geertz comments:

格尔茨评论道： 

> The brooding note of Loring Danforth’s “Introduction” (Who am I to be saying these things, by what right, and to what purpose, and how on earth can I manage honestly to say them?) is one now very widely heard, in various forms and with various intensities.

> 洛林·丹福思的“引言”中的忧思笔记（我是谁能说这些事情，因为什么权利，为了什么目的，以及我怎样才能诚实地说出这些话）是一种非常普遍的冥想风格，且有不同的表现形式和表现程度。[ 出自克利福德·格尔茨，《论著与生活：作为作者的人类学家》，斯坦福大学出版社，1988]

Clifford Geertz, an acute observer of style, calls attention here to one mark of reflexive style. Reflexive styles might consider classic style to be naïve or philistine; but there is nothing naïve in a tacit acceptance of incongruities in the nature of writing and nothing philistine in making unhedged choices.

克利福德·格尔茨对风格的观察很敏锐，特别提醒冥想风格的一个特征。冥想风格可能认为古典风格太天真或太愚昧；但是默许不合时宜的写作不是天真，做出正面抉择也并非愚昧。
