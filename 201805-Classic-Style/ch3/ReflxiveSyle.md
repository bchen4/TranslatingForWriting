# Classic Style Is Not Reflexive Style
# 古典风格不是自省风格

In the classic stand on presentation, writing is a perfectly transparent window through which a subject is presented; the ability of the writer and the sufficiency of the language to serve this presentation are never in doubt.

在古典风格的呈现中，写作是一面完美透明的窗户，事物透过这面窗被呈现出来；毋庸置疑，作者的能力以及语言的充分必将实现这种呈现。毋庸置疑，语言本身足以呈现，作者亦有呈现的能力。（静-动）

This fundamental stand opposes classic style irreconcilably to an entire family of styles in which the writing itself shares a focus with any other possible subject, and the difficulties of the writing are brought to the reader’s attention.

Classic writing can present anything, but even when the subject presented is writing itself, the focus is not shared. La Bruyère talks about the conditions of good writing when he says, “It is necessary to express what is true in order to write naturally, powerfully, sensitively,” but he does not call attention to his own writing as he is doing so. When Alexander Pope criticizes bad verse in An Essay on Criticism, the writing itself imitates the faults he discusses, becoming a focus of the reader’s attention: “And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line.” Classic style is a performance style, and while classic writers can be skeptical about anything else, they cannot be skeptical about their own ability to perform when they are in the act of performing. The classic writer assumes that his subject can be known and can be expressed without distortion. These are enabling conventions of the style. The classic writer is not necessarily free of doubts about his enterprise, but as a performer he must appear to be. An acrobat, a concert pianist, an actor cannot simultaneously perform and question the possibility of performing. Classic style is a style for performance, not a style for questioning its own competence.

古典风格可以呈现任何事物，但就算呈现的事物是写作本身，也不会引起注意。La Bruyère谈到成就佳作的条件时说，“写作要想自然、有力、生动，必需表达出真相” ，即使谈及写作他也没有让读者注意到它。Alexander Pope在An Essay on Criticism中批评拙劣的韵文时，其写作本身正模仿他所讨论的缺点，引起了读者的关注：“十六个低调词汇缓行在沉闷的线条上。”古典风格是一种表演风格，古典风格作家可能会怀疑任何其它事情，但在表演过程中绝不能怀疑自己的表演能力。古典风格的作家假定他要呈现的事物可以被认识，可以被完好地表达。古典风格基于这些协定才可实现。古典风格的作家并不一定对他的写作确定无疑，但作为一名表演者，他必须表现出坚定。杂技、钢琴演奏家、演员不能在表演的同时质疑表演的可能性。古典风格的本职是表演，而不是质疑其自身能力。
古典风格可以呈现任何事物，哪怕呈现的是写作本身，也不会引起联合注意。La Bruyère谈到造就佳作的条件时说，“写作要想自然、有力量、生动，必需表达出真相” ，但他在谈写作时并没有让读者注意到它。Alexander Pope在An Essay on Criticism中批判拙劣的韵文时，通过模仿这种拙劣使读者注意到写作本身：“十四个低调词汇爬上沉闷的线条。”古典风格是一种表演风格，古典风格作家可能会怀疑任何其它事情，但表演时绝不能怀疑自身的表演能力。古典风格的作家假定他要呈现的事物可以被认识，且能被完好地表达。基于这些协定古典风格得以实现。古典风格的作家并不一定对他的写作确凿无疑，但作为一名表演者，他必须表现成这样。杂技师、钢琴演奏家、演员不能在表演的同时还质疑表演的可能性。古典风格的本职是表演，而非质疑其自身能力。

When we open a cookbook, we completely put aside—and expect the author to put aside—the kind of question that leads to the heart of certain philosophic and religious traditions. Is it possible to talk about cooking? Do eggs really exist? Is food something about which knowledge is possible? Can anyone else ever tell us anything true about cooking? These questions may lead to enlightenment or to satori; they do not lead to satisfying dinners. Readers of cookbooks expect to see cooking treated directly, as if such metaphysical and epistemological questions could never be entertained by anyone, even though we know they can be and have been entertained by saints and sages. We do not expect the writer to be immobilized by preliminary discussions of whether it is possible to talk about “cooking,” if such a thing even exists. Classic style similarly puts aside as inappropriate philosophical questions about its enterprise. If it took those questions up, it could never get around to treating its subject, and its purpose is exclusively to treat its subject.

当我们打开一本讲烹饪的书，我们完全不会考虑——也不会期待作者考虑——那种引向某种哲学和宗教传统的问题。烹饪可能被谈论吗？鸡蛋真的存在吗？食物可能用知识来解释吗？有任何其他人能告诉我们烹饪的真谛吗？这些问题可能给人启示或顿悟；但他们无法带给我们愉悦的晚餐。烹饪书籍的读者希望看到的是直接讲烹饪的东西，好似没人会考虑这种抽象的认识论问题，虽然我们知道圣贤人士会考虑它们。我们不希望作者因为开头讨论“谈论 ‘烹饪’是否可能”导致后续行动瘫痪，就算存在这样的话题。与此类似，古典风格不会考虑不合时宜的写作哲学问题。如果讨论这些问题，古典风格可能无暇处理它的对象，而它的目的是专门处理它的对象。

Raising skeptical doubts about the writer’s own enterprise is a feature of nonclassic self-conscious styles. In such styles, the writer’s chief, if unstated, concern is to escape being convicted of philosophical naïveté about his own enterprise. Such a writer is careful to gesture periodically toward the contingent frame of his own discourse, to disclaim any belief that his writing can treat any subject directly. The style stays in the foreground, inextricably mingled with its announced subject. It is marked with formulaic hedges concerning the possibility of knowledge, the contingency of knowledge, and the ability of language to express knowledge. “Impotence principles” such as the doctrine that discourse can never be about anything except itself share the focus of the writer’s attention with any possible subject.

非古典风格有一类自我意识风格，其中一个特征是作者对自己写的东西提出疑问。这类风格的作者从哲学视角看待自己写的东西，不言自明，他们的主要问题是避免被批评为太天真。这样的作者时不时小心翼翼地示意自己可能的话语框架，不认为他的写作可以直接处理任何话题。这种风格很容易引起读者的注意，与其论述的话题混淆一起很难区分。它的特点是对知识的可能性、知识的偶然性和语言表达知识的能力采取迂回的态度。“无能原则”，比如话语永远不可能涉及其本身以外的任何东西，它的读者既会注意到任何可能的话题，也会注意到作者关注的问题。

Classic prose does not discuss doubts or fears about its own enterprise, not because it is naïve, but because it has chosen something incompatible with reflexive inquiry. We can question the possibility of acting or we can act, but we cannot do both at once. Classic writers make an unspoken choice: they act. Rather than discuss the possibility of action, they put that possibility to the test, and let the reader be the judge.

古典散文不会讨论它对写下的东西的疑惑或担忧，不是因为它天真，而是因为它选择了与反思探究对立的东西。我们可以质疑行动是否可行，或者我们可以行动起来。古典风格的作家做了一个不言自明的决定：行动。不是讨论行动是否可行，而是验证这种可行性，让读者自己来判断。

Clifford Geertz, in Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author, quotes an example of such a self-referential and self-questioning style from the introduction, “Self and Other,” to Loring Danforth’s The Death Rituals of Rural Greece:

Clifford Geertz在Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author一文中引用了一个自我参照和自我质疑风格的例子
from the introduction, “Self and Other,” to Loring Danforth’s The Death Rituals of Rural Greece:

Anthropology inevitably involves an encounter with the Other. All too often, however, the ethnographic distance that separates the reader of anthropological texts and the anthropologist himself from the Other is rigidly maintained and at times even artificially exaggerated. In many cases this distancing leads to an exclusive focus on the Other as primitive, bizarre, and exotic. The gap between a familiar “we” and an exotic “they” is a major obstacle to a meaningful understanding of the Other, an obstacle that can only be overcome through some form of participation in the world of the Other. 

人类学必然会涉及与他人的相遇。民族距离使人类学文本的读者、人类学家本人与其他人区别开来，这种距离往往被严格保持下来，有时甚至被人为地夸大。 在许多情况下，这种疏远导致对他人的独有专注，原始的，离奇的和异国情调的。 熟悉的“我们”与异国情调的“他们”之间的差距，是他人有意义的理解的主要障碍，这个障碍只能通过某种参与他人的世界的形式来克服。

Geertz comments:
The brooding note of Loring Danforth’s “Introduction” (Who am I to be saying these things, by what right, and to what purpose, and how on earth can I manage honestly to say them?) is one now very widely heard, in various forms and with various intensities.

Loring Danforth“引言”中的忧思笔记（我是谁能说这些事情，我有什么权利，为了什么目的，以及我怎样才能诚实地说出这些话）？现在普遍可听到，形式、强度各自不一。

Clifford Geertz, an acute observer of style, calls attention here to one mark of reflexive style. Reflexive styles might consider classic style to be naïve or philistine; but there is nothing naïve in a tacit acceptance of incongruities in the nature of writing and nothing philistine in making unhedged choices.

Clifford Geertz，风格的敏锐观察者，特别提到自省风格的一个特征。自省风格可能认为古典风格太天真或太愚昧；但是默认接受写作中的不相称之处不算天真，做出正面应对的选择也不是愚昧。
