Classic Style Is Not Prophetic Style古典风格不是先知风格
Despite a shared affinity for unqualified assertion, classic style has little in common with prophetic or oracular style because prophetic style cannot place the reader where the writer is. The reader cannot verify through his own experience what the writer experiences. Classic style does not depend upon powers that are divine or that are available only to special people, or powers whose availability is subject to some agency that human beings do not control or understand. Prophetic style, on the other hand, depends entirely upon such powers. The ability of the prophetic writer to know truth has come through powers that are not part of the usual human complement. Even their possessor does not possess them reliably: these powers come and go in ways that he does not understand or control.

尽管看起来都是绝对肯定，但古典风格与先知风格或神谕风格几乎没有共同点，因为先知风格无法把读者放到作者的位置。读者无法通过自己的体验验证作者的体验。古典风格依靠的不是天赐的或特殊人才有的力量，也不是人类无法掌控或理解的力量。然而先知风格，完全取决它们。先知风格的作者了解真相的能力，其所需力量不在人类基本能力范围内。甚至拥有这些力量的人都无法可靠地拥有它们：这些力量如何发生或消失，他自己也无法理解和掌控。

In Western culture, the best-known examples of prophetic style are in the Old Testament. When the sons of Jesse come before Samuel, the eldest, Eliab, makes an immediate impression on the aging judge, who concludes, “Here, before the Lord, is his anointed king.” It is a response that stands for human insight and wisdom; it is the judgment of a wise and experienced person. Any reader who knows what Samuel knows would presumably share his view of Eliab. But in the model scene of the prophetic style, human judgment does not and cannot share the sacred perspective, even though it can, through a privileged channel, receive the fruit of divine wisdom. The Lord responds to Samuel: “Take no account of it if he is handsome and tall; I reject him. The Lord does not see as man sees; men judge by appearances but the Lord judges by the heart.”

在西方文化中，先知风格最著名的的例子是《旧约》。当耶西的儿子们来到撒母耳面前，年迈的审判官对大儿子以利押留下了直接印象，他说：“耶和华受膏的王，就在他面前。”这是一个代表人类洞见和智慧的回答; 这是一个聪明老练的人的判断。任何读者如果知道撒母耳知道的，可能对以利押有同样看法。但是先知风格的典型场景是，人类没看到也无法看到神看到的，尽管人类因为某种特权享有神的智慧之果。耶和华对撒母耳说：“不要看外貌英俊身材高硕，我不挑他。耶和华不像人看人；人看外貌，耶和华看內心。”

One of the most famous representations of the model scene of prophetic style occurs in the opening chapter of the Book of Jeremiah. The passage begins with the archetypical claim of the prophetic writer, that he is not speaking in his own voice and not conveying his own judgments. “The Word of the Lord came to me.” It then passes on to a dialogue between the Word of God and the inarticulate Jeremiah.

耶利米书的开篇章节，是最能代表先知风格的典型场景的例子之一。篇章伊始采用了先知作者的典型口吻，他不是用自己的声音说话，也不是表达自己的见解。 “耶和华的话临到我说。”然后它在达耶和华与不善言辞的耶利米之间传话。

“Before I formed you in the womb . . . I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”

我未将你造在腹中……我已派你作列国的先知。

“Ah! Lord God,” I answered, “I do not know how to speak; I am only a child.” . . . Then the Lord stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and said to me, “I put my words into your mouth. This day I give you authority over nations and over kingdoms, to pull down and to uproot, to destroy and to demolish, to build and to plant.”

我就说：“主耶和华啊！我不知怎样说，因为我是年幼的。”……于是耶和华伸手按我的口，对我说，“我已将当说的话传给你。看哪，我今日立你在列邦列國之上，为要施行拔出、拆毀、毁坏、倾覆，又要建立、栽植。”

The equally famous representation of the calling of Isaiah establishes the same points although they run the risk of being lost in the fabulous vision in which they are embedded. The prophet inexplicably finds himself in the realm of the divine, where he does not belong. (“Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips. . . .”) But his deficiency is miraculously removed and “unclean lips” are made capable of speaking divine words. He volunteers his services as a messenger and receives his commission: “Go and tell this people. . . .”

以赛亚使命树立了相同观点，同样是先知风格著名的代表，尽管它们被置于美妙愿景中，且又有迷失其中的风险。 先知莫名地发现自己处于神圣的领地——他不属于的地方。 （“祸哉，我灭亡了。因为我是嘴唇不洁的人…….”）但他的缺陷奇迹般地消失了，“不洁的嘴唇”也能说出圣洁的话。他志愿担任信使，并接受委托：“你去告诉这百姓说……”

The poet, painter, engraver, and printer William Blake is one of the few widely admired modern writers to make extensive use of prophetic style in something like its prototypical form. But prophetic style is not confined to the sacred literature of ancient Israel or an occasional genius-crackpot like Blake. It has its modern form on all those occasions in which a writer claims to be a channel for impersonal and normally inaccessible truth. The writer makes claims to authority, but not his own authority and not the kind of authority that is available to others. “History tells us” (and, tacitly, “I am history’s spokesman”) is a common anthem of politicians and of those mysterious channels of wisdom who write opinion columns in newspapers; prophetic style is used by jurists who on occasion claim to speak the judgment of principles or of long-dead foundation jurists; it is the style of all those innumerable spokesmen who tell us what “tradition,” “common sense,” or “common decency” demand and of those slightly less numerous spokesmen who tell us what fashions state or what eras or epochs tell us.

集诗人、画家、雕刻家和版画家于一身的威廉·布莱克，作为广泛采用先知风格（比如它的典型形式）的现代作家，是少数备受推崇的作家之一。但先知风格并不局限于以色列古老神圣的文学，或像布莱克这样难得一遇的天才怪人。作者宣称可以传达不近人情且通常无法获知的真相，所有这类场景建立的都是现代形式的先知风格。作者自称权威，却不是自己的权威，也不是某种可以被大家接近的权威。政治家和报纸舆论专栏的神秘智者经常说：“历史告诉我们”（且默认为“我是历史的发言人”）；法学家们也使用先知风格，比如他们有时声称审判原则如此，或者逝去的法学奠基人认为如此；很多发言人采取这种风格，告诉我们“传统”、“常识”、“基本礼仪”要求什么，还有一类代言人，人数相对较少，也是用这种风格告诉我们时尚表达着什么，时代或年代告诉了我们什么。
