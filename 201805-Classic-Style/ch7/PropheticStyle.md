# Classic Style Is Not Prophetic Style
# 古典风格不是先知风格

Despite a shared affinity for unqualified assertion, classic style has little in common with prophetic or oracular style because prophetic style cannot place the reader where the writer is. The reader cannot verify through his own experience what the writer experiences. Classic style does not depend upon powers that are divine or that are available only to special people, or powers whose availability is subject to some agency that human beings do not control or understand. Prophetic style, on the other hand, depends entirely upon such powers. The ability of the prophetic writer to know truth has come through powers that are not part of the usual human complement. Even their possessor does not possess them reliably: these powers come and go in ways that he does not understand or control.

尽管在绝对肯定这点上相似，但古典风格与先知风格或神谕风格几乎没有其它共同点，因为先知风格无法把读者放到作者的位置。读者无法通过自己的体验验证作者的体验。古典风格依靠的不是天赐的或非一般人才有的力量，也不是人类无法掌控或理解的一些力量。然而先知风格，完全取决这些力量。先知风格的作者了解真相的能力，不在人类基本能力范围内。甚至它们的拥有人无法可靠地拥有它们：这些力量如何发生或消失，他自己也无法理解和掌控。

In Western culture, the best-known examples of prophetic style are in the Old Testament. When the sons of Jesse come before Samuel, the eldest, Eliab, makes an immediate impression on the aging judge, who concludes, “Here, before the Lord, is his anointed king.” It is a response that stands for human insight and wisdom; it is the judgment of a wise and experienced person. Any reader who knows what Samuel knows would presumably share his view of Eliab. But in the model scene of the prophetic style, human judgment does not and cannot share the sacred perspective, even though it can, through a privileged channel, receive the fruit of divine wisdom. The Lord responds to Samuel: “Take no account of it if he is handsome and tall; I reject him. The Lord does not see as man sees; men judge by appearances but the Lord judges by the heart.”

在西方文化中，最著名的先知风格的例子是《旧约》。当耶西的儿子们来到撒母耳面前，年迈的审判官对大儿子以利押留下了直接印象，他说：“耶和华受膏的王，就在他面前。”这是一个代表人类洞见和智慧的回答; 这是一个聪明老练的人的判断。任何读者如果知道撒母耳知道的，可能对以利押有同样看法。但是先知风格的典型场景是，人类没看到也无法看到神看到的，尽管人类因为某种特权享有神的智慧之果。耶和华对撒母耳说：“不要看外貌英俊身材高硕，我不挑他。耶和华不像人看人；人看外貌，耶和華看內心。”

One of the most famous representations of the model scene of prophetic style occurs in the opening chapter of the Book of Jeremiah. The passage begins with the archetypical claim of the prophetic writer, that he is not speaking in his own voice and not conveying his own judgments. “The Word of the Lord came to me.” It then passes on to a dialogue between the Word of God and the inarticulate Jeremiah.

耶利米书的开篇章节，是最能代表先知风格的典型场景的例子之一。篇章伊始采用了先知作者的典型口吻，他不是用自己的声音说话，也不是表达自己的见解。 “耶和华的话临到我说。”然后它传达着耶和华与不善言辞的耶利米之间的对话。

“Before I formed you in the womb . . . I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”

我未将你造在腹中……我已派你作列国的先知。

“Ah! Lord God,” I answered, “I do not know how to speak; I am only a child.”. . . Then the Lord stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and said to me, “I put my words into your mouth. This day I give you authority over nations and over kingdoms, to pull down and to uproot, to destroy and to demolish, to build and to plant.”

我就说：“主耶和华啊！我不知怎样说，因为我是年幼的。”……于是耶和华伸手按我的口，对我说，“我已将当说的话传给你。为要施行拔出、拆毀、毁坏、倾覆，又要建立、栽植。”

The equally famous representation of the calling of Isaiah establishes the same points although they run the risk of being lost in the fabulous vision in which they are embedded. The prophet inexplicably finds himself in the realm of the divine, where he does not belong. (“Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips. . . .”) But his deficiency is miraculously removed and “unclean lips” are made capable of speaking divine words. He volunteers his services as a messenger and receives his commission: “Go and tell this people. . . .”

同样着名的以赛亚呼召的表现形式也确立了相同的观点，尽管它们在嵌入它们的美妙愿景中冒着迷失的风险。 先知莫名地发现自己处于神圣的领地，他不属于的地方。 （“祸就是我！我迷了路，因为我是嘴唇不洁的人......”）但他的缺陷奇迹般地消除了，“不洁的嘴唇”也变得能够说出神圣的话语。他以志愿者的身份服务于他的使者，并接受他的委托：“去告诉这些人……”

The poet, painter, engraver, and printer William Blake is one of the few widely admired modern writers to make extensive use of prophetic style in something like its prototypical form. But prophetic style is not confined to the sacred literature of ancient Israel or an occasional genius-crackpot like Blake. It has its modern form on all those occasions in which a writer claims to be a channel for impersonal and normally inaccessible truth. The writer makes claims to authority, but not his own authority and not the kind of authority that is available to others. “History tells us” (and, tacitly, “I am history’s spokesman”) is a common anthem of politicians and of those mysterious channels of wisdom who write opinion columns in newspapers; prophetic style is used by jurists who on occasion claim to speak the judgment of principles or of long-dead foundation jurists; it is the style of all those innumerable spokesmen who tell us what “tradition,” “common sense,” or “common decency” demand and of those slightly less numerous spokesmen who tell us what fashions state or what eras or epochs tell us.

William Blake集诗人、画家、雕刻家和印刷工为一身，在一些典型形式上广泛运用先知风格，是少数备受推崇的现代作家之一。但先知方格并不限于神圣的文学或an occasional genius-crackpot like Blake。在所有这些场合中，作者宣称是一种非个人渠道或通常不可获取真相的渠道，它有它的现代形式。作者自称为权威，但并非自己的权威，也不是某种可以被其他人获得的权威。“历史告诉我们”（并且默认为“我是历史的发言人”）是政治家和那些在报纸上写舆论专栏的那些神秘的智慧渠道的共同声音; 预言风格被法学家们所使用，他们偶尔声称说出原则的判断或长期死去的基础法学家；所有那些无数的发言人都会告诉我们什么是“传统”，“常识”，“共同体面的”需求，还有那些稍微少一些的代言人告诉我们什么是时尚，什么时代或什么时代告诉我们的风格。
