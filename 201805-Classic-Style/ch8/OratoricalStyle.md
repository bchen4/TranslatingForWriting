# Classic Style Is Not Oratorical Style
# 古典风格不是演讲（演说）风格

The central model for most discussions of rhetoric in classical antiquity seems to be oratory. Even when something is written—rather than spoken—in an oratorical style and meant to be read silently by one individual, its effects are meant for the ear. The text may be written down formally in sentences, but its units are periods and are defined by sound.

古代经典作品常常讨论的雄辩言辞，其主要模式似乎是演讲。演讲风格中，甚至一些书面表达——不是口头演讲——只为给个体默读，它的效果是为了震撼耳朵。尽管文本用句子正式写出来，它的单元划分按照一定节奏，由声音决定。

The model scene of oratorical style is neither casual nor spontaneous. Its prototypical occasion is the assembly of a group of people faced by a public problem—like military invasion, the forming and maintenance of public values, or the judging of social offenders.

演讲风格的典型场景既非随意也非自发。它的典型场合是面临公众问题的群体集会——如军事入侵，树立和维护公共价值观，判决社会罪犯等。

This scene creates a cast. Leadership is necessary, and the assembly’s job is to respond to a candidate who puts himself forward. The orator assumes a role as leader of both the public moment and the setting of policy. He invites the audience to yield to his rhythms and to his views, which he typically presents as a version of common verities. The audience may coalesce and perhaps join in as his chorus, or remain splintered and perhaps heckle him randomly. The successful orator molds the audience into one body with one voice and one governing view. To the outsider, he may appear to be alternatively a demagogue with an echo or the selfless conductor of the common music.

这个场景创造了一种角色关系。领导力必不可少，而群体的任务是响应主动走到前台的候选人。演说者承担了领导的角色，既作为公众时刻的领导，也作为制定政策的领导。他邀请听众跟随他的节奏和主张，通常这些主张被他说成某种普遍的事实。听众可能联合起来，加入他的合唱团，或者三三两两，随意起哄。成功的演说者把听众拧成一股绳，他们有统一的声音，有统一的指导观点。在外人看来，他也许是被众人拥护的政客，又或是无私的大众音乐指挥。

In a slight variant of this model scene and cast, the audience has as its head a judge or perhaps a king who rules on policy under advice from the full audience. When Odysseus debates with Akhilleus over the best time for the Akhaians to engage the Trojans on the field of war, the judge is High King Agamemnon, but the entire council is the audience with Agamemnon at its head. Akhilleus, who wants to avenge immediately the slaying of Patroclos, vents his anger and represents his singularity:

这种典型场景和角色关系有一个稍微不同的变体：听众有一位领头人，他是一名法官或国王，负责听取全部听众的建议和制定政策。当奥德修斯与阿喀琉斯争论，对阿喀琉斯来说进攻特洛伊的最佳时机时，至高的阿伽门农国王是法官，而阿伽门农领导的听众是整个委员会。阿喀琉斯恨不得立即为死去的帕特罗克洛斯复仇，此时的他怒不可遏、行为怪异：

Let us recover joy of battle soon, that’s all!
No need to dither here and lose our time, 
our great work still undone. When each man sees 
Akhilleus in a charge, crumpling the ranks 
of Trojans with his bronze-shod spear, let each 
remember that is the way to fight his man!

让我们立马回归战场的欢乐，那是一切！
无需在这里犹豫，浪费时间，
我们的大业还未完成。当每个战士看到
阿喀琉斯冲锋陷阵，用他的青铜长矛攻陷特洛军队，
每个人都记住那才是和敌人战斗的姿态。

Odysseus, by far the better orator, isolates Akhilleus by assuming for himself the role of defender and spokesman of the audience, thereby making it natural for the audience to identify with him and his views:

奥德修斯是当时最好的演说家，通过扮演守卫者和听众代言人的角色，孤立阿喀琉斯，听众则自然而然地认同他和他的主张。他说：

Brave as you are, and like a god in looks,
Akhilleus, do not send Akhaian soldiers
into the fight unfed! Today’s mêlée
will not be brief, when rank meets rank, and heaven
breathes fighting spirit into both contenders.
No, tell all troops who are near the ships to take
roast meat and wine, for heart and staying power.
No soldier can fight hand to hand, in hunger,
all day long until the sun goes down!
Though in his heart he yearns for war, his legs
go slack before he knows it: thirst and famine
search him out, and his knees fail as he moves.
But that man stayed with victualing and wine
can fight his enemies all day: his heart
is bold and happy in his chest, his legs
hold out until both sides break off the battle!
Come, then, dismiss the ranks to make their breakfast.

你们多么勇敢，一副上帝的姿态，
阿喀琉斯，别把阿卡亚的战士
送到食不果腹的战斗中去！今天的战斗
不可能速战速决，当军队与军队相遇，
上天为双方注入战斗精神。 
不，告诉所有战船附近的军队， 
带上烤肉和酒，振作士气保持战斗力。
没有士兵能赤手空拳、饥肠辘辘
战斗一整天，直到太阳下山！
即使内心渴望战斗，他的双腿已疲乏，
他未意识到：饥渴发现了他，他的膝盖无法支撑前进。
但拥有食物和美酒，
他能够维持与敌人整天的战斗：
他内心勇敢，心胸开阔，
他的双腿将支撑到双方停止战斗！
来吧，解散列队，准备早饭。

Since oratory is designed to unite many listeners, whose attention may flag, it cannot be either very flexible or very subtle. Nuance is always risky with such an audience. Consequently, the surface of oratory usually looks like a few points with the help of a lot of music. Going along with the music helps the audience go along with the points, as Kenneth Burke has remarked in A Rhetoric of Motives:

因为演讲的目的是团结听众，避免他们注意力涣散，所以它不能灵活多变或难以捉摸。面对这样的听众，细致入微的变化通常有风险。因此，表面上演讲看起来是很少的信息配合着大量的音乐。跟随音乐的节奏，能保障听众抓住重点，就像坎尼斯·伯克在《动机修辞学》中写道：

We know that many purely formal patterns can readily awaken an attitude of collaborative expectancy in us. For instance, imagine a passage built about a set of oppositions (“we do this, but they on the other hand do that; we stay here; but they go there; we look up, but they look down,” etc.) Once you grasp the trend of the form, it invites participation regardless of the subject matter. Formally, you will find yourself swinging along with the succession of antitheses, even though you may not agree with the proposition that is being presented in this form. Or it may even be an opponent’s proposition which you resent—yet for the duration of the statement itself you might “help him out” to the extent of yielding to the formal development, surrendering to its symmetry as such. Of course, the more violent your original resistance to the proposition, the weaker will be your degree of “surrender” by “collaborating” with the form. But in cases where a decision is still to be reached, a yielding to the form prepares for assent to the matter identified with it. Thus, you are drawn to the form, not in your capacity as a partisan, but because of some “universal” appeal in it. And this attitude of assent may then be transferred to the matter which happens to be associated with the form.
 
我们知道，许多纯粹固定的模式，容易唤起我们对合作的预期态度。例如，想象一篇文章建立的一组对比模式（“我们做这个，但他们做那个；我们待在这里，但他们去那里；我们向上看，但他们向下看，”等等）。一旦你掌握这种形式上的趋势，无论主题内容是什么，它都会吸引你的参与。形式上，你会发现自己沉浸在一种连续的对比中，即使你可能不认同通过这种形式提出的主张。或者它甚至可能是反对者提出的主张，你憎恨它——然而因为叙述本身的连续不断，你可能会屈服并逐渐认同这种形式上的递进和它的对称形式，从而“帮他摆脱困境”。当然，起初你对这种主张反抗越强烈，你就越不会“屈服”，越不会与这种形式“合作”。但在这种情况下，你依然可以达成共识，认同形式是认同内容的前奏。因而，你被形式吸引，不是因为你是虔诚的信徒，而是因为它某些 “普遍的”吸引力。这种认同的态度，可能使你转为认同和形式相关的内容。 

Burke, in writing this passage, surely had in mind Pericles’ Funeral Oration, as reconstructed by Thucydides, in which Pericles attempts to guide the Athenians at a difficult historical moment in their sense of communal values by offering them an image of themselves that just happens coincidentally to serve Pericles’ own purposes. In this oration, which takes place at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles follows the model of Odysseus in the debate with Akhilleus. Like Odysseus, Pericles casts himself in the role of spokesman for the audience. His oration has as its most central and famous parts a series of explicit and implicit contrasts between the Athenians and citizens of rival cities:

伯克在写这段话时，一定想到了修昔底德整编的那篇伯里克利的“葬礼演说”：领雅典人民危在旦夕的历史时刻，伯里克利试图引导他们理解公共价值观，他描述了他们自身的形像，这恰恰是伯里克利自己的目的。这篇演说，发生在伯罗奔尼撒战争第一年的年末，伯里克利模仿了奥德修斯与阿喀琉斯辩论的模式。像奥德修斯一样，伯里克利扮演了听众的代言人。他演说中最重要最著名的部分，对雅典人民与敌城人民进行了一系列明确又含蓄的对比：

Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it: the real shame is not taking practical measures to escape from it. Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the state as well. . . . We are capable at the same time of taking risks and of estimating them beforehand. Others are brave out of ignorance; and, when they stop to think, they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.

我们为美着迷，但不会因此奢华无度；我们崇尚思想，但不会因此变得柔弱。我们合理使用财富，不去夸富。至于贫穷，我们无需羞于承认：真正的羞耻是不采取实际行动脱离贫苦。这里的每个个体，不仅关注他的个人事务，同样也关注国家事务……我们勇于承担风险，亦能够事先评估。有些人的勇敢是因为无知；当他们停下去思考，便开始恐惧。然而真正勇敢的人，深知幸福与痛苦对生活的意义，他无所畏惧，走出去，迎接即将面临的事物。

Later, after the plague and the second invasion of Athenian land by the Peloponnesians, the Athenians grow angry at Pericles. To defuse their anger, he summons them to Assembly and revives the oratorical theme of the previous Funeral Oration:

后来，瘟疫爆发，接着伯罗奔尼撒人第二次入侵雅典土地，伯里克利开始令雅典人愤怒。为了平息他们的愤怒，他召集民众举行集会，再次宣称先前“葬礼演说”的演讲主题：

No doubt all this will be disparaged by people who are politically apathetic; but those who, like us, prefer a life of action will try to imitate us, and, if they fail to secure what we have secured, they will envy us. 

不关心政治的人必会贬低这一切；但那些同我们一样，在生活中注重行动的人，会尝试模仿我们，如果他们无法获得我们拥有的，他们就会忌妒我们。

All who have taken it upon themselves to rule over others have incurred hatred and unpopularity for a time; but if one has a great aim to pursue, this burden of envy must be accepted, and it is wise to accept it. Hatred does not last for long; but the brilliance of the present is the glory of the future stored up for ever in the memory of man. It is for you. . . . Do not send embassies to Sparta: do not give the impression that you are bowed down under your present sufferings! To face calamity with a mind as unclouded as may be, and quickly to react against it—that, in a city and in an individual, is real strength.

所有主动承担这种忌妒统治别人的人，曾一度不受欢迎、令人憎恨；但如果一个人有伟大的目标，他必须承受这种妒忌的负担，接受它才是明智的做法。怨恨不会持续太久；但此刻的光辉是未来的荣耀，永远留存在人的记忆里。它是为你……不要向斯巴达派送大使：不要让人以为你们被当前的苦难压垮！面对磨难，请保持尽可能阳光的心态，迅速回应它——那才是一座城、一个人真正的力量。

The contrasts between oratorical style and classic style can be illustrated right from this text of Thucydides. He comments on Pericles’ oratory in a style whose impulses served as a prototype for the inventors of classic style:

演讲风格和古典风格的差异，可以从修昔底德的这篇文字得到印证。他评论伯里克利演说时采用了一种风格，这种风格的动机为创造古典风格的人提供了原型：

In this way Pericles attempted to stop the Athenians from being angry with him and to guide their thoughts in a direction away from their immediate sufferings. So far as public policy was concerned, they accepted his argument, sending no more embassies to Sparta and showing an increased energy in carrying on the war; yet as private individuals they still felt the weight of their misfortunes. The mass of the people had had little enough to start with and had now been deprived of even that; the richer classes had lost their fine estates with their rich and well-equipped houses in the country, and, which was the worst thing of all, they were at war instead of living in peace. In fact, the general ill feeling against Pericles persisted, and was not satisfied until they had condemned him to pay a fine. Not long afterwards, however, as is the way with crowds, they re-elected him to the generalship and put all their affairs into his hands. By that time people felt their own private sufferings rather less acutely and, so far as the general needs of the state were concerned, they regarded Pericles as the best man they had. . . . He survived the outbreak of war by two years and six months, and after his death his foresight with regard to the war became even more evident.  For Pericles had said that Athens would be victorious if she bided her time and took care of her navy, if she avoided trying to add to the empire during the course of the war, and if she did nothing to risk the safety of the city itself. But his successors did the exact opposite, and in other matters which apparently had no connection with the war private ambition and private profit led to policies which were bad both for the Athenians themselves and for their allies.The roles adopted by Pericles the orator and Thucydides the classic writer differ sharply. Pericles leads a group but Thucydides merely presents something to the reader. Pericles is interested but Thucydides disinterested. Pericles is the conductor of the rhythm of the crowd but Thucydides is merely talking in his natural voice. Pericles wants something from his audience but Thucydides does not. Pericles asserts and advises but Thucydides merely observes. Pericles is formal, Thucydides casual. Pericles speaks in a public occasion but Thucydides is telling the reader something spontaneously. Pericles affirms common wisdom, but Thucydides operates at all moments as an independent thinker. Pericles expects his audience to notice his oratory while Thucydides pretends that his prose is transparent. Pericles asks his audience to look harder to see what needs seeing, while Thucydides is simply pointing out something that is obvious once presented. Of course, in fact, Thucydides’ supposed historical account is a relentless argument about the nature of crowds and democracies, but he presents his conclusions the same way one might point out the first turning of the leaves in fall, as a fact, although a subtle fact. It is a characteristic strength of classic style to persuade by default. The classic writer offers no explicit argument at all. Ostensibly, he offers simply a presentation. If the reader fails to recognize that the ostensible presentation is a device of persuasion, then he is persuaded without ever realizing that an argument has occurred. It is always easier to persuade an audience unaware of the rhetorician’s agenda.

伯里克利试图用这种方式，平息雅典人对他的愤怒，引导人们转移思想放下他们当下的悲苦。只要他们关注公共政策，他们就会接受他的主张，不会再派大使去斯巴达，对继续战斗充满干劲；然而作为个人，他们面对灾难不堪重负。多数民众的基础几乎不够重新开始，而现在连仅有的一点也被剥夺；富人阶层失去了他们良好的社会地位，还有乡下富丽堂皇、应有尽有的的房子，最糟糕的是，他们身处战乱而非和平。事实上，人民对伯里克利普遍的反对态度一直在持续，直到他被处以罚款，他们才满意。不久，群众行驶了一贯的作风，又推选他为将领，把他们所有的事务都托付给他。那时人们觉得他们个人的困难不算什么，心里只有城邦全体的需求，他们认为伯里克利是他们遇到的最伟大的人……自战争爆发两年六个月后，伯里克利牺牲了，他对战争的远见卓识在他死后愈加突出。因为伯里克利曾说过，如果雅典静候时机，用心经营海军；如果雅典在战争期间放弃加入帝国；如果雅典不拿它的城邦冒险，雅典将会胜利。但他的继任者做着完全相反的事情，在其它显然无关战争的事务上，因为他的个人野心和个人利益制定的政策，对雅典人民对他们的同盟毫无益处。演说家伯里克利和古典风格作者修昔底德采用的角色完全不同。伯里克利领导一群人，而修昔底德只是向读者呈现。伯里克利带着个人利益，修昔底德客观公正。伯里克利指挥着群众的节奏，但修昔底德只是用他自然的语调说话。伯里克利想从他的听众获取什么，但修昔底德不需要。伯里克利总是宣称和建议，但修昔底德只是观察。伯里克利很正式，但修昔底德很随意。伯里克利是公开演讲，但修昔底德只是随口告诉读者什么事情。伯里克利宣称共同智慧，但修昔底德任何时刻都表现出一位独立的思考者。伯里克利期望他的听众注意他的雄辩言辞，但修昔底德假装他的散文透明无形。伯里克利要求他的听众看得仔细些才能看到需要看的东西，而修昔底德只是指出那些经呈现就显而易见的事物。当然，事实上，修昔底德所谓的历史叙述，是关于群众与民主的性质的不朽争论，但他呈现结论的方式，犹如指出叶子在秋天第一次变色的事实，虽然这是一个不易察觉的事实。在不知不觉中说服他人是古典风格特有的力量。古典风格的作者没有任何明显的争辩。他看起来只是呈现而已。如果读者看不出，这种表面的呈现是一种说服手段，那么他被说服时，不曾意识到自己被劝说。听众如未意识到修辞家的意图，说服他往往更容易。
 
The differences between the oratorical and classic models of speech are considerable because oratory and the writing styles based on it have a lot of practical work to do. These oratorical styles cannot concern themselves with thought exclusively or even mainly. They have not merely to keep an audience made up of many individuals attentive and alert but also to take a heterogeneous group of individuals and mold them into a unified body directed at action or the making of policy for action. They make use of what the audience already thinks much more than they introduce new observations or refine old ones.
 
演讲风格和古典风格的话语模式相差很大，因为演讲及其对应的写作风格有很多实际工作要做，不会专门关注思想，甚至思想都不是主要关注点。他们的观众不仅由许多全神贯注的个体组成，还有形形色色的人组成的群体，他们把这些听众联合起来，一起行动，或者为行动制定政策。他们常常利用听众已经思考过的东西，很少引入新观点或者深化老观点。
