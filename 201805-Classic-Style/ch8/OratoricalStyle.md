# Classic Style Is Not Oratorical Style
# 古典风格不是演讲（演说）风格

The central model for most discussions of rhetoric in classical antiquity seems to be oratory. Even when something is written—rather than spoken—in an oratorical style and meant to be read silently by one individual, its effects are meant for the ear. The text may be written down formally in sentences, but its units are periods and are defined by sound.

多数古代修辞学讨论的主要模式似乎是演讲术。甚至人们有时写一些东西——而不是说——也是以演说的形式，而且写出来的东西会由人们各自默读，它们是用来听的。尽管文本可能会以句子的形式正式写下来，但它的单位是重复的，而且是以声音定义的。

The model scene of oratorical style is neither casual nor spontaneous. Its prototypical occasion is the assembly of a group of people faced by a public problem—like military invasion, the forming and maintenance of public values, or the judging of social offenders.

演说风格的典型结构既非偶然也非自然形成。它的原型出自一群人在处理公共问题时的集会，像军事入侵，拟定以及维持公共价值标准，评判社会争端等。

This scene creates a cast. Leadership is necessary, and the assembly’s job is to respond to a candidate who puts himself forward. The orator assumes a role as leader of both the public moment and the setting of policy. He invites the audience to yield to his rhythms and to his views, which he typically presents as a version of common verities. The audience may coalesce and perhaps join in as his chorus, or remain splintered and perhaps heckle him randomly. The successful orator molds the audience into one body with one voice and one governing view. To the outsider, he may appear to be alternatively a demagogue with an echo or the selfless conductor of the common music.

这个场景创造了一个角色。领导必不可少，而且集会的任务是回应把自己推到前面的候选人。演说者承担了领导的角色，既作为公开场合的领导，又制定政策。他邀请听众认同他的演说韵律和他的观点，他会介绍一些普遍的事实。听众可能认同他，也可能协助他，或者总是挑刺，或者可能不时诘问他。成功的演说者用一致的声音和统一的观点把观众联合起来。在外人看来，他似乎是一名随声附和的煽动家，亦或者是大众乐曲的忘我的指挥者。

In a slight variant of this model scene and cast, the audience has as its head a judge or perhaps a king who rules on policy under advice from the full audience. When Odysseus debates with Akhilleus over the best time for the Akhaians to engage the Trojans on the field of war, the judge is High King Agamemnon, but the entire council is the audience with Agamemnon at its head. Akhilleus, who wants to avenge immediately the slaying of Patroclos, vents his anger and represents his singularity:

在典型结构和角色的轻微变体中，听众已把它的领导当作一名能够听取所有听众的建议从而修订政策的法官或国王。当奥德修斯与Akhilleus争论，对Akhaians而言，特洛伊参战的最佳时机时， 法官是至高的阿伽门农国王，而且整个议会都是拥护阿伽门农作为领导的信奉者。 想要对Patroclos的杀戮马上复仇的Akhilleus发泄着他的愤怒，并表现出他的怪异：


Let us recover joy of battle soon, that’s all!
No need to dither here and lose our time, our great work still undone. 
When each man sees Akhilleus in a charge, crumpling the ranks of Trojans with his bronze-shod spear, let each remember that is the way to fight his man!
让我们尽快恢复战场的欢乐，那便是所有的一切！
无需在这里犹豫，浪费时间，我们的大事仍未完成。
当每个男人看到Akhilleus冲锋陷阵，用青铜铁骑手持长矛攻陷特洛伊的军队，让每个人记住那便是和敌人一起战斗的方式。


Odysseus, by far the better orator, isolates Akhilleus by assuming for himself the role of defender and spokesman of the audience, thereby making it natural for the audience to identify with him and his views:
奥德修斯，那时最好的演说者，把自己假装成防御者和听众的发言者，借此让听众自然而然地认同他及其观点，从而孤立了Akhilleus。他的观点如下：


Brave as you are, and like a god in looks,    
Akhilleus, do not send Akhaian soldiers into the fight unfed!   
Today’s mêlée will not be brief, when rank meets rank, and heaven breathes fighting spirit into both contenders.

勇敢如你我，上帝一目了然，  
Akhilleus，别把阿克哈尼亚的战士派送到不受支持的战争中去了。  
今天的战斗不再是短暂的，当军队各自相遇，天空把战斗的精神吹进了双方脆弱士兵的心里。  

No, tell all troops who are near the ships to take roast meat and wine, for heart and staying power.  
No soldier can fight hand to hand, in hunger, all day long until the sun goes down!  
Though in his heart he yearns for war, his legs go slack before he knows it: thirst and famine search him out, and his knees fail as he moves.  
But that man stayed with victualing and wine can fight his enemies all day: his heart  
is bold and happy in his chest, his legs hold out until both sides break off the battle!  
Come, then, dismiss the ranks to make their breakfast.  

不，告诉所有战船附近的军队，带着烤肉和葡萄酒，用心积蓄力量。  
没有士兵可以肉搏战，白刃战，饿着战斗，一直战斗至太阳落下！  
虽然在他打心底渴望战争，他的双腿在战斗前开始懈怠，他知道：口渴和饥荒让他无法行走，他的膝盖无法动弹。  
但那些拥有粮食和酒的人能够和他的敌人战斗一整天：他内心勇敢，心胸开阔，他的双腿持续行走，直到双方停止战斗！  
来吧，解散列队，吃早饭。  

Since oratory is designed to unite many listeners, whose attention may flag, it cannot be either very flexible or very subtle. Nuance is always risky with such an audience. Consequently, the surface of oratory usually looks like a few points with the help of a lot of music. Going along with the music helps the audience go along with the points, as Kenneth Burke has remarked in A Rhetoric of Motives:

因为演讲术被设计用来联合许多听众，他们的注意力会疲乏，因此它不能是多变，或难以捉摸的。面对这样的听众，模棱两可总是危险的。因此演讲时总会有伴随着点音乐。在音乐的协助下，听众会赞同演讲者的观点，就像Kenneth Burke在《修辞动机》中写道的：

We know that many purely formal patterns can readily awaken an attitude of collaborative expectancy in us. For instance, imagine a passage built about a set of oppositions (“we do this, but they on the other hand do that; we stay here; but they go there; we look up, but they look down,” etc.) Once you grasp the trend of the form, it invites participation regardless of the subject matter. 

众所周知，很多单一正式的模板易唤起我们内心期待合作的态度。例如，想象一名乘客做出了一系列反对的行为（“我们做这个，他们偏偏做那个；我们待在这里，但他们偏去那里；我们向上看，但他们偏向下看”，等等。）一旦你抓住了这种形式的趋势，无论什么主题它会邀请参与。

Formally, you will find yourself swinging along with the succession of antitheses, even though you may not agree with the propo sition that is being presented in this form. Or it may even be an opponent’s proposition which you resent—yet for the duration of the statement itself you might “help him out” to the extent of yielding to the formal development, surrendering to its symmetry as such. 

形式上，你会发现自己正在不断的比较中犹豫，即使你可能不认同正在以这种形式提出的主张。或者它甚至可能是一位反对者的主张，你仍然因为持续的主张本身厌恶它，你可能会从“帮他走出来”到向形式的发展屈服，也屈服于它的对称。

Of course, the more violent your original resistance to the proposition, the weaker will be your degree of “surrender” by “collaborating” with the form. But in cases where a decision is still to be reached, a yielding to the form prepares for assent to the matter identified with it. Thus, you are drawn to the form, not in your capacity as a partisan, but because of some “universal” appeal in it. And this attitude of assent may then be transferred to the matter which happens to be associated with the form.

当然，你起初对这种主张反抗越强烈，你就越不会“屈服”于和这种形式的“合作”。但在这种情况下，你依然可以达成共识，对形式的屈服体现了你对与它一致的事情的认同。因而，你对形式疲于应付，却无法成为它的一名虔诚的信徒，但因为一些对它“广泛的”呼吁。而且这种认可的态度可能被转移到碰巧和形式有关联的事物上。

Burke, in writing this passage, surely had in mind Pericles’ Funeral Oration, as reconstructed by Thucydides, in which Pericles attempts to guide the Athenians at a difficult historical moment in their sense of communal values by offering them an image of themselves that just happens coincidentally to serve Pericles’ own purposes. In this oration, which takes place at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles follows the model of Odysseus in the debate with Akhilleus. Like Odysseus, Pericles casts himself in the role of spokesman for the audience. His oration has as its most central and famous parts a series of explicit and implicit contrasts between the Athenians and citizens of rival cities:

Burke在写这段话时，头脑中一定在想伯里克利的葬礼演说，它由修西得底斯改写，在这篇演说中，雅典人民在理解他们的公共价值观念遇到困难的历史时刻，伯里克利试图给他们提供一幅他们自身的画像，来引导他们，而这刚好同时又符合了伯里克利自己的意图。在这篇诞生于伯罗奔尼撒战争第一年年末的葬礼演说中，伯里克利采纳了奥德修斯与Akhilleus辩论的模式。像奥德修斯一样，伯里克利扮演了听众的代言人。他演说中最重要，最著名的部分，有一系列雅典人与其竞争城邦居民明确且含蓄的对比：

Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it: the real shame is not taking practical measures to escape from it. Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the state as well. . . . We are capable at the same time of taking risks and of estimating them beforehand. Others are brave out of ignorance; and, when they stop to think, they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.

我们爱美，但不奢侈挥霍；我们崇尚智力但不柔弱。我们合理使用财富，而不炫耀。我们无需因贫穷而羞耻：真正的羞耻是不采取实际行动进而逃避它。这里的每个人不仅关注他们的个人事务，同样也关注城邦的公共事务……我们能在承担风险的同时，提前评估它们。别人因无知而鲁莽；一旦他们驻足思考，他们开始恐惧。但真正勇敢的人，他能深刻明白生命的意义，无论生活是甜美还是糟糕，他并未被吓住，而是勇敢的走出去，拥抱未来。

Later, after the plague and the second invasion of Athenian land by the Peloponnesians, the Athenians grow angry at Pericles. To defuse their anger, he summons them to Assembly and revives the oratorical theme of the previous Funeral Oration:

后来，在瘟疫和伯罗奔尼撒人第二次侵占雅典土地后，雅典人渐渐对伯里克利很愤怒。为了减少他们的愤怒，他把民众召集到集会上，重申了先前葬礼演说的主题：

No doubt all this will be disparaged by people who are politically apathetic; but those who, like us, prefer a life of action will try to imitate us, and, if they fail to secure what we have secured, they will envy us. 

毫无疑问，这一切都会被冷漠的政客贬低；但这些人，像我们一样在生活中注重行动的人，会试着模仿我们，而且，如果他们无法获得我们已经获得的东西，他们就会忌妒我们。

All who have taken it upon themselves to rule over others have incurred hatred and unpopularity for a time; but if one has a great aim to pursue, this burden of envy must be accepted, and it is wise to accept it. Hatred does not last for long; but the brilliance of the present is the glory of the future stored up for ever in the memory of man. It is for you. . . . Do not send embassies to Sparta: do not give the impression that you are bowed down under your present sufferings! To face calamity with a mind as unclouded as may be, and quickly to react against it—that, in a city and in an individual, is real strength.

所有接受这一切并统治他人的人已经在某一时期招致了讨厌和怨恨；但如果一个人在追求一个伟大的目标，那这个忌妒的负担也一定能承受，并且最明智的是接受它。怨恨一直持续；但此刻的光辉会留在人们记忆中，成为未来的荣耀。它是为你……不要向斯巴达派送信使：不要向此刻的苦难屈膝！以尽可能开朗的心态面对灾难，并对它迅速做出反应——即，每座城邦，每个人才是真正的力量。

The contrasts between oratorical style and classic style can be illustrated right from this text of Thucydides. He comments on Pericles’ oratory in a style whose impulses served as a prototype for the inventors of classic style:

修西得底斯的这份文本恰当地阐释了演说风格和古典风格间的差异。他认为伯里克利的演说方式，推动古典风格的发明者提出了其原型。

In this way Pericles attempted to stop the Athenians from being angry with him and to guide their thoughts in a direction away from their immediate sufferings. So far as public policy was concerned, they accepted his argument, sending no more embassies to Sparta and showing an increased energy in carrying on the war; yet as private individuals they still felt the weight of their misfortunes. The mass of the people had had little enough to start with and had now been deprived of even that; the richer classes had lost their fine estates with their rich and well-equipped houses in the country, and, which was the worst thing of all, they were at war instead of living in peace. In fact, the general ill feeling against Pericles persisted, and was not satisfied until they had condemned him to pay a fine. 

以这种方式，伯里克利试图阻止希腊人对他的愤怒，并引导他们的思想脱离当时的遭遇。只要人们关注公共政策，他们就会接受他的论证，不会送更多的信使到斯巴达，在打仗时更卖力；然而作为单独的个体，他们仍然对灾祸不堪重负。多数民众几乎没有足够的（信心）重新开始，而现在甚至连这些都被剥夺了；富人阶层已经损失了他们郊区昂贵并装修考究的房子，以及其它琐碎的财产，而这是所有事情里最糟糕的，他们处在战争中，而不是生活在和平年代。事实上，一般的反对伯里克利的坏情绪持续着，直到他被判处罚款后才开始对他满意了。

Not long afterwards, however, as is the way with crowds, they re-elected him to the generalship and put all their affairs into his hands. By that time people felt their own private sufferings rather less acutely and, so far as the general needs of the state were concerned, they regarded Pericles as the best man they had. . . . He survived the outbreak of war by two years and six months, and after his death his foresight with regard to the war became even more evident.  For Pericles had said that Athens would be victorious if she bided her time and took care of her navy, if she avoided trying to add to the empire during the course of the war, and if she did nothing to risk the safety of the city itself. But his successors did the exact opposite, and in other matters which apparently had no connection with the war private ambition and private profit led to policies which were bad both for the Athenians themselves and for their allies.

不久后，然而，这正是群众的行事方式，他们重新选他为领导，并把所有的事务都托付给他。直到那时，人们觉得他们各自的遭遇并不算什么，并且，只要是城邦关心的一般需求，他们都会把伯里克利作为代表他们的最佳人选……他自战争爆发两年半后幸存下来，在他死后，他对战争的预见更加明朗。因为伯里克利曾说如果雅典争取时间，好好经营海军；如果雅典不把君权引入战争中；如果雅典不过分顾虑城邦自身的安全，雅典将会胜利。但伯里克利的继任者却做了完全相反的事情，换句话说，他做的事情显然没有把战争自身的野心和利益联系起来，最终做出了一些对雅典人民和他们的同盟都很坏的政策。

The roles adopted by Pericles the orator and Thucydides the classic writer differ sharply. Pericles leads a group but Thucydides merely presents something to the reader. Pericles is interested but Thucydides disinterested. Pericles is the conductor of the rhythm of the crowd but Thucydides is merely talking in his natural voice. 

演说者伯里克利和古典风格作者修西得底斯采用的角色完全不同。伯里克利带领一群人，然而修西得底斯只是在向读者呈现一些事情。伯里克利充满偏见，修西得底斯则客观公正。伯里克利是群众韵律的指挥者，但修西得底斯仅在用自然的语调讲话。

Pericles wants something from his audience but Thucydides does not. Pericles asserts and advises but Thucydides merely observes. Pericles is formal, Thucydides casual. Pericles speaks in a public occasion but Thucydides is telling the reader something spontaneously. Pericles affirms common wisdom, but Thucydides operates at all moments as an independent thinker. Pericles expects his audience to notice his oratory while Thucydides pretends that his prose is transparent. 

伯里克利试图从他的听众获取一些东西，修西得底斯则不。伯里克利会断言并建议，但修西得底斯只是观察。伯里克利是正式的，修西得底斯则是随意的。伯里克利在公开场合演讲，修西得底斯只是自然地告诉读者一些事实。伯里克利肯定普遍智慧，修西得底斯则作为一名独立的思考者每一刻都在思考。伯里克利期待他的听众关注他的演说，然而，修西得底斯自以为他的散文是显而易见的。

Pericles asks his audience to look harder to see what needs seeing, while Thucydides is simply pointing out something that is obvious once presented. Of course, in fact, Thucydides’ supposed historical account is a relentless argument about the nature of crowds and democracies, but he presents his conclusions the same way one might point out the first turning of the leaves in fall, as a fact, although a subtle fact. It is a characteristic strength of classic style to persuade by default. The classic writer offers no explicit argument at all. Ostensibly, he offers simply a presentation. If the reader fails to recognize that the ostensible presentation is a device of persuasion, then he is persuaded without ever realizing that an argument has occurred. It is always easier to persuade an audience unaware of the rhetorician’s agenda.

伯里克利要求他的听众努力观看来明白需要看见什么，然而修西得底斯只是简单地指出那些一经呈现就显而易见的事物。当然，事实上，修西得底斯假设的历史的解释是一个关于群众和民主残酷的论断，但他就像某人指出第一片秋天旋转的落叶一样，呈现出他的结论作为一个事实，尽管是个难以捉摸的事实。它是古典风格自然而然说服他人的特有的一种力量。古典风格作者根本不会下明确的论断。显而易见，他只是在呈现。如果读者无法识别出表面的呈现是一种说服的策略，那他被说服甚至没意识到一个结论已经产生了。说服一名不懂修辞学家设计的听众（读者）往往更容易。

The differences between the oratorical and classic models of speech are considerable because oratory and the writing styles based on it have a lot of practical work to do. These oratorical styles cannot concern themselves with thought exclusively or even mainly. They have not merely to keep an audience made up of many individuals attentive and alert but also to take a heterogeneous group of individuals and mold them into a unified body directed at action or the making of policy for action. They make use of what the audience already thinks much more than they introduce new observations or refine old ones.

演说风格和古典风格的讲话模式间的差异有很多，因为演说和写作模式都涉及很多实践的工作。这些演说风格不关注他们本身的思想是否专一，甚或大体一致。他们不会仅仅很多个体中的一名听众留心或警惕，而且会找混杂的一群个体，然后把他们塑造成一个指向同一行动的联合体，或者为行动制定政策的统一联合体。比起引入新的观察或提炼以前的观察，他们更多地会利用听众已经思考过很多次的内容。
