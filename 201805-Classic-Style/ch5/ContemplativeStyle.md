# Classic Style Is Not Contemplative Style
# 古典风格不是冥想风格

Classic style implicitly defines itself as a normal, practically inevitable, perspective. It makes continual if tacit claims to transparency; it does not interpret; it merely presents. These claims are, of course, false. When the style succeeds, it simply obscures the distinction and manages to pass off interpretation as presentation.

古典风格把自己含蓄地定义成一种平常得几乎无法避开的视角。虽未明示但它反复强调透明性；它不去解释；它只是呈现。这这些说法当然不属实。实现这种风格只是模糊两者的区别。从而得以将解释冒充为呈现。

In contemplative style, the distinction between presentation and interpretation is always observed: the writer sees something, presents it to the reader, and then interprets it. The stress is on the interpretation, but the transition is always explicitly marked. E. B. White, a master of the contemplative essay, characteristically observes this sequence, as he does in “The Ring of Time,” a dazzling piece of writing that is entirely unclassic. White describes himself casually observing a practice session of a circus, watching the lion tamer, a big, brown horse, and then a circus rider. He tells the reader precisely what he sees and how he sees it: “As she emerged in front of us, I saw that she was barefoot, her dirty little feet fighting the uneven ground. In most respects she was like any of two or three dozen showgirls you encounter if you wander about the winter quarters of Mr. John Ringling North’s circus, in Sarasota—cleverly proportioned, deeply browned by the sun, dusty, eager, and almost naked.” White describes what he sees and what anyone there with him might see. And then he contemplates what he sees and offers an interpretation: “I became painfully conscious of the element of time. Everything in the hideous old building seemed to take the shape of a circle, conforming to the course of the horse. The rider’s gaze, as she peered straight ahead, seemed to be circular, as though bent by force of circumstance; then time itself began running in circles, and so the beginning was where the end was, and the two were the same, and one thing ran into the next and time went round and around and got nowhere.” He then sees that the girl is deluded: “She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.” The associations, the connections, the very way he turns a commonplace event into an allegory of time belong to him alone; contemplative style assumes that this is not what someone standing next to him would see. In contemplative style, the focus is on the interpretation and not on the event.

总能在沉思风格中看到呈现与解释的区别：作者看到什么东西，将它呈现给读者，然后对此解释。这种风格的重心在解释上，但两者的过度总是很明显。E.B.怀特，擅长沉思风格，看到了这种次序特征，正如他在“The Ring of Time”中做的那样，这是一种绚烂但非常不古典的写作方式。怀特描述自己在一场马戏团训练中漫不经心地观看驯狮师、一匹棕色大马和一名马戏团骑手。 他准确地告诉读者他看到了什么以及如何看到的：“当她出现在我们面前时，我看到她赤着脚，脏兮兮的小脚踩踏着不平坦的地面。如果你冬天在萨拉索塔约翰林格诺斯先生马戏团街区里the winter quarters of Mr. John Ringling North’s circus, in Sarasota闲逛过，你就知道她的很多地方都像你随便遇到的二三十名歌舞女演员一样——身材匀称、太阳晒成的棕肤色、风尘仆仆、目光渴望以及几乎全裸。”怀特描述了他所看到的以及与他同行的任何人可能看到的。然后他沉思他所看到的并进行解释：“我开始痛苦地觉察到时间元素。这栋丑陋陈旧的建筑里的一切似乎都是圆的，和马的跑道一样。女骑手直视着前方，目光仿佛被周围环境的力量弯曲，犹如一个圆弧。然后时间本身开始绕起圈子，结束时回归起点，两者一模一样，一个进入下一个，时间不断地轮回，哪也没去成。”接着他又看到女孩被时间欺骗：“当她相信她能绕着圆环，骑出完整的圈，最终回到开始时的年龄时刻，（我想）她处在令人羡慕的生命时刻。”他从一件平常的事情联想到时间的讽喻方式只属于他自己；沉思风格认为这不是他旁边的人能看到的。沉思风格的焦点在解释上而非事物本身。

White stands in a tradition of American preachers who present a text and then interpret it. The common scene that White sees becomes, through his contemplation of it, an allegory of the world, which the reader is allowed to see because White offers his superior vision. He begins to discuss things that in principle the reader has no way of checking, and he does not hesitate to refer to himself as something like an authority. “The circus comes as close to being the world in microcosm as anything I know; in a way, it puts all the rest of show business in the shade. Its magic is universal and complex. Out of its wild disorder comes order; from its rank smell rises the good aroma of courage and daring; out of its preliminary shabbiness comes the final splendor.” The asymmetry between writer and reader is profound. White takes the attitude that the reader could be perfectly competent and yet, in looking at this scene, see none of what he sees.

怀特遵循了一种美国传教士的传统，他们说出一段文字然后解释它。怀特以沉思的方式把看到的普通场景变成一种对世界的讽喻，读者得以看到这样的讽喻是因为怀特提供了他卓越的想象。他开始讨论原则上读者无法验证的事物，且毫不犹豫地将自己称为权威。 “马戏团成为一种世界的缩影，接近我所知道的任何事物；其余的表演部分被置于某种形式的阴影中。它的魔力普遍又复杂。狂野无序中生出秩序; 难闻的味道中升起一股美好的勇敢气息; 原先的破败演变成最后的辉煌。这种作家与读者之间的不对称非常明显。怀特认为读者可以完全胜任，但看这个场景时读者看不到他看到的。

The first fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style is thus that classic style presents something but contemplative style presents an interpretation of something. This entails many different decisions concerning truth, presentation, cast, and scene.

古典风格和沉思风格之间的第一个根本区别是古典风格呈现一件事物，而沉思风格呈现的是一件事物的解释。这决定了在真相、呈现、受众和场景上的不同选择。

The second fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style has to do with thought and language. Classic language is an instrument for presenting the product of thought according to the order of reason, not according to the sequence of experience. In contemplative style, writing is itself the engine of discovery: the writing is a record of the process of the writer’s thinking, quite independent of its relation to the order of reason. In contemplative style, the touchstone of the writing is the process of the writer’s contemplation. That process and the writer’s engagement in it often become an explicit subject of the writing:

古典风格与沉思风格之间的第二个根本区别在于思想和语言。古典风格的语言呈现思想产物依据的是论证的顺序而非经验的顺序。沉思风格的发现由写作本身推动：写作用来记录作者的思维过程，与论证的顺序无关。沉思风格中，衡量写作的标准是作家沉思的过程。这个沉思过程和作者参与其中的体验往往成为赤裸裸的写作话题：

In attempting to recapture this mild spectacle, I am merely acting as recording secretary for one of the oldest of societies—the society of those who, at one time or another, have surrendered, without even a show of resistance, to the bedazzlement of a circus rider. As a writing man, or secretary, I have always felt charged with the safekeeping of all unexpected items of worldly or unworldly enchantment, as though I might be held personally responsible if even a small one were to be lost. . . . The ten-minute ride the girl took achieved—as far as I was concerned, who wasn’t looking for it, and quite unbeknownst to her, who wasn’t even striving for it—the thing that is sought by performers everywhere. . . . As I watched with the others, our jaws adroop, our eyes alight, I became painfully conscious of the element of time. . . . i thought: “She will never be as beautiful as this again”—a thought that made me acutely unhappy—and in a flash my mind (which is too much of a busybody to suit me) had projected her twenty-five years ahead.

为了再现这种温和的场面，我只是以文秘的身份服务其中一个最古老的组织——这里的人曾一次次被马戏团骑手的惊艳降服，没有任何反抗。作为一个写作的人或文秘，我一直觉得有责任保存好所有世俗的或超凡的惊艳之物，好像只要丢失了一小件我也可能为此承担个人责任……女孩在十分钟内完成了——而我，没有寻找它，她也不知道我，她甚至都没有为之奋斗——达到各地表演者所追求水平。当我和其他人一起观看时，我们的下巴往下张，我们的眼睛被吸引下去，我开始痛苦地觉察到时间元素……我想：“她再也不会像这样美丽了”——这个想法令我极其难过——有那么一瞬间在我的脑海里（我真是想得太多了）我看见她25年后的模样。

Rather than presenting truth, White often quotes his own contemplation, giving its history:

怀特没有呈现事实，而是经常引用自己的思考，给出它的历史：

“She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.”. . . And then I slipped back into my trance, and time was circular again—time, pausing quietly with the rest of us, so as not to disturb the balance of a performer.

“当她相信她能绕着圆环，骑出完整的圈，最终回到开始时的年龄时刻，（我想）她处在令人羡慕的生命时刻。”……接着我继续回到沉思的状态，时间又变成了圆弧——时间，静静地与剩余的我们一同静止，不去打扰表演者的平衡。

In these passages, White uses many of the surface marks of clarity, precision, and accurate vocabulary that are associated with classic style. But his fundamental stand on the elements of style is very far from the classic stand. Regardless of language or phrasing, none of these passages could fit comfortably in a classic text.

在这些文章中，怀特采用了许多古典风格相关的表面特征：清晰、准确、用词恰当。但他对风格要素的立场与古典风格相差甚远。不考虑语言和措辞，这些文章没有一篇说得上是古典风格文本。

Because contemplation is a superior achievement by a superior individual who talks about the difficulties of contemplation, contemplative style splits into two modes that are not incompatible and that can be used alternately. Sometimes, the contemplative writer succeeds fully in his achievement: thought and language can be adequate. Thoreau frequently writes as if he has been successful in his contemplations. But sometimes, the contemplative writer fails in his achievement, and feels compelled to settle for what is merely his best effort. White often does this, as when he writes, “But it is not easy to communicate anything of this nature.”

因为沉思是一位卓越的人讨论沉思的困难所取得的卓越成就，沉思风格可分为两种相互兼容可交替使用的模式。 有时，沉思风格的作者完全成功地实现这种风格：思想和语言都可以适用。梭罗的写作常常体现了这种成功的沉思方式。但有时这位沉思风格的作家失败了，又不得不勉强接受这是自己的最佳努力了。怀特经常这样做，就像他写道：“但这种性质的交流并不容易。”

At other moments, White seems to take the extreme stand that language is always inadequate to the task: “It has been ambitious and plucky of me to attempt to describe what is indescribable, and I have failed, as I knew i would. But I have discharged my duty to my society; and besides, a writer, like an acrobat, must occasionally try a stunt that is too much for him.”

有时候，怀特似乎采取一种极端的立场认为语言无法满足表达任务：“我鼓起野心和勇气尝试描述不可描述之物，我没做到，我知道我做不到。但我履行了我对社会的责任；而且，像杂技演员一样，作家必须偶尔尝试超越能力范围的特技动作。”
