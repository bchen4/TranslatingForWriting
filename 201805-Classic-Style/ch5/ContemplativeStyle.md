# Classic Style Is Not Contemplative Style
# 古典风格不是冥想风格

Classic style implicitly defines itself as a normal, practically inevitable, perspective. It makes continual if tacit claims to transparency; it does not interpret; it merely presents. These claims are, of course, false. When the style succeeds, it simply obscures the distinction and manages to pass off interpretation as presentation.

古典风格的视角应用普遍，几乎不可避免。即使未明示，它一再主张透明；它只是呈现，不做解释。这些说法当然是错的。一旦实现了这种风格，它们的区别就被弱化，解释亦如同呈现。

In contemplative style, the distinction between presentation and interpretation is always observed: the writer sees something, presents it to the reader, and then interprets it. The stress is on the interpretation, but the transition is always explicitly marked. E. B. White, a master of the contemplative essay, characteristically observes this sequence, as he does in “The Ring of Time,” a dazzling piece of writing that is entirely unclassic. White describes himself casually observing a practice session of a circus, watching the lion tamer, a big, brown horse, and then a circus rider. He tells the reader precisely what he sees and how he sees it: “As she emerged in front of us, I saw that she was barefoot, her dirty little feet fighting the uneven ground. In most respects she was like any of two or three dozen showgirls you encounter if you wander about the winter quarters of Mr. John Ringling North’s circus, in Sarasota—cleverly proportioned, deeply browned by the sun, dusty, eager, and almost naked.” White describes what he sees and what anyone there with him might see. And then he contemplates what he sees and offers an interpretation: “I became painfully conscious of the element of time. Everything in the hideous old building seemed to take the shape of a circle, conforming to the course of the horse. The rider’s gaze, as she peered straight ahead, seemed to be circular, as though bent by force of circumstance; then time itself began running in circles, and so the beginning was where the end was, and the two were the same, and one thing ran into the next and time went round and around and got nowhere.” He then sees that the girl is deluded: “She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.” The associations, the connections, the very way he turns a commonplace event into an allegory of time belong to him alone; contemplative style assumes that this is not what someone standing next to him would see. In contemplative style, the focus is on the interpretation and not on the event.

呈现与解释的区别在冥想风格中相当明显：作者为读者呈现他看到的东西，然后解释它。这种风格着重解释，但两者的过渡极为分明。作家E.B.怀特擅用冥想风格，就遵守这种过渡关系。他的作品《时光之环》就是一个例子，风格绚烂但完全不古典。怀特描述自己在一场马戏团观演活动中，漫不经心地观赏驯狮员、一匹棕色大马和一名马戏团骑手。他准确地告诉读者，他看到了什么，以及如何看到的：“她出现在我们面前，我看到她赤着脚，脏兮兮的小脚踩在凹凸不平的地板上。如果你冬天的时候，在萨拉索塔逛过约翰·玲玲·诺斯先生的马戏团，她的很多方面与随便遇到的二三十名歌舞女演员没差——身材匀称、太阳晒成的棕肤色、风尘仆仆、目光渴望、几乎全裸”[ 出自E.B.怀特，《南部来信》，原刊于《纽约客》，1956年4月7日，第39-49页，重刊为《时间之环》，收录于《罗盘的方向：东西南北的来信》，纽约，Harper & Row 出版社，第51-60页，亦收录于《怀特散文集》，纽约，Harper & Row 出版社，第142-149页]。怀特描述他看到的场景，描述与他同行的任何人可能看到的场景。然后他思考和解释他的观察：“觉察到时间元素开始令我痛苦。这栋丑陋陈旧的建筑的一切似乎都是圆的，和马的跑道一样。女骑手直视前方，视线仿佛被周围的环境扭曲，看起来像一个圆弧。然后时光开始绕起圈子，起点即终点，两者一模一样，一件事物进入下一件事物，时光不断轮回，没去任何地方。”接着他又想象女孩如何被欺骗：“当她相信她能绕着圆环，做出一个完整的圆圈，她的年纪无论在终点还是起点完全相同，（我想）她处在一种令人羡慕的生命时刻。”怀特独有的个性化联想和连接，把一件平常事物变成时间的讽喻；冥想风格认为他旁边的人无法看到这些，它注重解释而非事物本身。

White stands in a tradition of American preachers who present a text and then interpret it. The common scene that White sees becomes, through his contemplation of it, an allegory of the world, which the reader is allowed to see because White offers his superior vision. He begins to discuss things that in principle the reader has no way of checking, and he does not hesitate to refer to himself as something like an authority. “The circus comes as close to being the world in microcosm as anything I know; in a way, it puts all the rest of show business in the shade. Its magic is universal and complex. Out of its wild disorder comes order; from its rank smell rises the good aroma of courage and daring; out of its preliminary shabbiness comes the final splendor.” The asymmetry between writer and reader is profound. White takes the attitude that the reader could be perfectly competent and yet, in looking at this scene, see none of what he sees.

怀特遵循的是一种美国传教士的传统，先分享一段文本，然后对此进行解释。普通场景经怀特思索加工，成为对世界的讽喻；怀特提供了自己卓越的视角，因此读者能看到这个讽喻。他开始讨论读者原则上无法验证的事物，还毫不犹豫地把自己当作权威。“马戏团是世界的缩影，与我所知道的任何事物相仿，某种程度使所有其它表演活动相形见绌。它的魔力既普遍又错综复杂。狂野无序生出秩序；刺鼻的味道飘出一股勇敢的芬芳；原先的破败演变成最后的辉煌。”作者与读者之间的不对称非常明显。怀特以为读者完全能够胜任，但读者看不到他看到的这个场景。

The first fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style is thus that classic style presents something but contemplative style presents an interpretation of something. This entails many different decisions concerning truth, presentation, cast, and scene.

由此说来，古典风格和冥想风格之间的第一个根本区别是：古典风格呈现事物，而冥想风格呈现对事物的解释。这决定了在真相、呈现、受众和场景上的不同立场。

The second fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style has to do with thought and language. Classic language is an instrument for presenting the product of thought according to the order of reason, not according to the sequence of experience. In contemplative style, writing is itself the engine of discovery: the writing is a record of the process of the writer’s thinking, quite independent of its relation to the order of reason. In contemplative style, the touchstone of the writing is the process of the writer’s contemplation. That process and the writer’s engagement in it often become an explicit subject of the writing:

古典风格与冥想风格之间的第二个根本区别，在于思想和语言。作者按照论证而非经历的先后关系，运用古典风格的语言呈现思想产物。在冥想风格中，写作本身是发现的引擎：写作记录作者的思考，与论证顺序无关。冥想风格衡量写作的标准，是作者的思考过程。这个思考过程和作者参与其中的体验，成为鲜明的写作话题：

> In attempting to recapture this mild spectacle, I am merely acting as recording secretary for one of the oldest of societies—the society of those who, at one time or another, have surrendered, without even a show of resistance, to the bedazzlement of a circus rider. As a writing man, or secretary, I have always felt charged with the safekeeping of all unexpected items of worldly or unworldly enchantment, as though I might be held personally responsible if even a small one were to be lost. . . . The ten-minute ride the girl took achieved—as far as I was concerned, who wasn’t looking for it, and quite unbeknownst to her, who wasn’t even striving for it—the thing that is sought by performers everywhere. . . . As I watched with the others, our jaws adroop, our eyes alight, I became painfully conscious of the element of time. . . . i thought: “She will never be as beautiful as this again”—a thought that made me acutely unhappy—and in a flash my mind (which is too much of a busybody to suit me) had projected her twenty-five years ahead.

> 面对马戏团骑手的惊艳，他们一次次被降服，连征兆式的反抗都没有，他们是最古老的马戏团之一。为了再现这种温和的场面，我只不过假装自己是这个团体的文秘。作为一个写作的人或文秘，我一直觉得有责任保存好所有世俗的或超凡的惊艳之物，好像假如丢失一小件，我可能要为此承担个人责任……女孩完成了十分钟的骑行表演，实现了所有表演者都追求的东西——而我，没有寻找它，于她还是一位陌生人，她也没有刻意争取它。当我和其他人一起观看时，我们伸着下巴，眼睛向下，我开始觉察到时间元素令我痛苦……我想：“她再也不会像现在这样美丽了”——这是个令人非常难过的想法——有那么一瞬间，我的脑海（如此好管闲事不像我）描摹了她25年后的模样。

Rather than presenting truth, White often quotes his own contemplation, giving its history:

怀特没有呈现真相，而是经常引用自己的思考，参照它的历史：

> “She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.”. . . And then I slipped back into my trance, and time was circular again—time, pausing quietly with the rest of us, so as not to disturb the balance of a performer.

> “当她相信她能绕着圆环，做出一个完整的圆圈，她的年纪无论在终点还是起点，都完全相同，（我想）她处在一种令人羡慕的生命时刻。”……接着我继续回到冥想状态，时间又变成圆弧——为了不干扰表演者的平衡，时间同余下的我们一起，悄悄地停下来。

In these passages, White uses many of the surface marks of clarity, precision, and accurate vocabulary that are associated with classic style. But his fundamental stand on the elements of style is very far from the classic stand. Regardless of language or phrasing, none of these passages could fit comfortably in a classic text.

在这些文章中，怀特采用了许多与古典风格有关的表面特征：清晰、准确、用词恰当。但他对风格要素的立场与古典风格的立场相差甚远。不考虑语言和措辞，这些文章没有一篇符合古典风格。

Because contemplation is a superior achievement by a superior individual who talks about the difficulties of contemplation, contemplative style splits into two modes that are not incompatible and that can be used alternately. Sometimes, the contemplative writer succeeds fully in his achievement: thought and language can be adequate. Thoreau frequently writes as if he has been successful in his contemplations. But sometimes, the contemplative writer fails in his achievement, and feels compelled to settle for what is merely his best effort. White often does this, as when he writes, “But it is not easy to communicate anything of this nature.”

冥想风格的思考，指优秀个体讨论思考的困难且取得优异成就，因此冥想风格分为两种模式，它们可兼容亦可交替使用。有时，作者能完全实现冥想风格：思想足够充分，语言足以表达。梭罗的写作常常取得这种思考的成功。但有时，冥想风格的作者无法达到这种风格，不得不接受他所能做的最大努力仅限于此。怀特经常这样做，就像他写道：“然而这种性质的交流很难。”

At other moments, White seems to take the extreme stand that language is always inadequate to the task: “It has been ambitious and plucky of me to attempt to describe what is indescribable, and I have failed, as I knew i would. But I have discharged my duty to my society; and besides, a writer, like an acrobat, must occasionally try a stunt that is too much for him.”

其它时候，怀特似乎采取一种极端的立场，认为语言无法完成表达任务：“我鼓起野心和勇气，尝试描述不可描述之物，我没做到，我知道我做不到。但我履行了我对社会的责任；再说作者必须像杂技演员一样，偶尔尝试超越能力范围的特技动作。”
