# Other Stands, Other Styles
# 其它立场，其它风格

There is nothing new in the idea that a style is effectively a stand on a small number of central issues, and therefore that many different mature styles are possible. Classical rhetoricians analyzed contrasting styles from this perspective, and routinely demonstrated that what was good or appropriate to one style might be bad or inappropriate to another. By contrast, many modern books on “style” have, for one reason or another, suggested that there are only two styles: good and bad. On closer inspection, it becomes apparent that each of these modern books is actually about one style, not about style generally. For example, Strunk and White or Williams and Colomb work from an implicit model of writing as meant to be read by either (a) an indefinite audience not defined by working roles but having more-or-less common cultural and social standards; or (b) a somewhat more definite audience of working professionals with corporately defined roles. What Strunk and White recommend is meant as good advice for the one style they have in mind; what Williams and Colomb recommend is good advice for the one style they have in mind. Both assume a single cast and a single scene. But consider texts with quite a different cast or scene, such as a diplomatic address opening peace negotiations in the Middle East, or Pericles’ Funeral Oration, or Samuel Johnson’s “Preface to Shakespeare,” or an address by Martin Luther King, Jr., to a large crowd of political activists. Were we to subject texts of this sort to editorial revision inspired by a careful study of Williams and Colomb or Strunk and White, the result would be simply the destruction of a style. These writers and speakers certainly break many of the “rules” to be found in Style and The Elements of Style, but that is because the styles discussed in those books are foreign to the styles chosen. It is unreasonable to expect that addressing a giant rally in Washington and writing a memo to the vice president for finance on the consequences of the new tax code should have lying behind them the same stylistic stand, or that either one of them should have the same stylistic stand as an article for The New Yorker or Johnson’s explanation of Shakespeare’s claim to our attention.

有个不算新鲜的观点认为，风格其实是对少数关键问题采取的立场，因此多种不同的成熟风格可能并存。基于这个观点，古典风格修辞学家对比分析了不同风格，得出这样的结论，并不让人感到意外：对一种风格有益或适宜，对另一种风格，则不一定有益或适宜。相反，由于某种原因，当代许多论述“风格”的书，实际上认为只存在两种风格：好风格和坏风格。仔细观察，很明显这些当代书籍每一本只是探讨一种风格，而非一般的风格。比如，斯特伦克和怀特写的《风格的要素》、威廉斯和科伦写的《风格》，他们论述的写作范例默认了两类受众：一类是不确定的受众，不分工作角色，但或多或少有共同的文化和社会标准；另一类是比较确定的受众，一般是专业人士，有确定的职业角色。斯特伦克和怀特提出的建议，指向他们自己心中的那种风格，威廉斯和科伦提出的建议，则指向他们自己心中的那种风格。两者指向的是单一的受众或场景。但如果文本的受众或场景截然不同——比如要启动中东和平谈判的外交致辞，或伯里克利的葬礼悼词，或塞缪尔·约翰逊的《莎士比亚戏剧集》序言，或马丁·路德·金对一大群政治积极分子的演讲——假如编辑依据斯特伦克和怀特、或者是威廉斯和科伦的建议，精心研究，校订这类文本，原文的风格将被毁掉。这些作者和演说家固然是违反了《风格》和《风格的要素》里提到的诸多规则，但那是因为他们采用的风格，与两本书中讨论的风格不一样。在华盛顿的一次盛大集会上发表演讲，或就新税法的后果向财务部副部长写备忘录，这两者，你不能指望它们采取相同的风格立场，也不能指望它们的风格立场同《纽约客》文章一样，或同约翰逊关于莎士比亚如何吸引我们的注意力的解说一样。

Classical textbooks such as Cicero’s Orator, the pseudo-ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Demetrius’s On Style list principal styles and explain their origins in different purposes, motives, or occasions. The standard list includes high, middle, and low style, otherwise called grand, middle, and simple. Demetrius gives instruction in restrained, elevated, elegant, and forcible style. Aristotle in the Rhetoric notes in passing that each kind of rhetoric has its own appropriate style: for example, the style of political speech cannot be the style of forensic speech because their originary purposes, scenes, and casts are opposed.

古典风格的教科书，比如西塞罗的《论演说》《修辞学》，被认为是西塞罗所著的《致贺仁宁论修辞书》, 和德米特里的《论风格》，罗列了主要风格，并从不同的目的、动机和场合解释了风格的起源。标准的分类包括高等、中等、低等风格，亦称作雄伟、中庸和平实风格。德米特里讲解了矜持、庄严、优雅和力量风格。亚里士多德在《修辞学》笔记里提及每种修辞都有它适宜的风格：比如，政治讲话的风格不能是法庭讲话的风格，因为它们最初的目的、场景和受众截然不同。

Classical rhetoricians routinely analyze the relationships between distinct styles. Elegant style, Demetrius explains, can unite with restrained style, but elevated style cannot, because elevated style and restrained style “stand in irreconcilable opposition and contrast”: their fundamental decisions are consistently incompatible.

古典风格的修辞学家常常分析不同风格间的关系。德米特里解释道，矜持风格可与优雅风格结合，但不能与庄严风格结合，因为庄严风格和矜持风格“相互矛盾不可共存”：决定它们的基本因素始终无法兼容。

Certain failures to achieve a successful style are so predictable and common as to constitute styles of their own, which might be called styles that do not succeed. The Rhetorica ad Herennium explains how swollen style, slack style, and meager style arise as particular kinds of failure to achieve grand, middle, or simple style, suggesting that each good style has at least one deformed double. Longinus introduces us to two deformed versions of sublime style, each of which is a product of a particular kind of failure to achieve it. Bloated style “comes from trying to outdo the sublime.” Adolescent style comes from puerility, “the opposite of greatness: abject, mean, smarmy, the lowest of faults. What is this puerility? Isn’t it just obviously the academic attitude, where over-elaboration ends in frigid failure? Writers fall into this fault because they want to be uncommon and exquisite, and to impress everybody, and instead they founder upon the trash of affectation.” Such failures all come “from the same cause, namely, today’s crazy passion for novel ideas.”

有些风格没有达到水准，不仅不意外，还很常见，因此变成了它们自有的风格，也许可以称作尝试失败的风格。西塞罗的《修辞学》解释了浮夸风格、懒散风格和单薄风格，分别是其作者尝试雄伟、中庸和平实风格并失败的结果，说明每一种好的风格对应至少一种拙劣风格。朗吉弩斯向我们介绍了两种与崇高风格对应的拙劣风格，它们是尝试崇高风格失败的一种特定产物。臃肿风格“是因为过分使用崇高风格”。幼稚风格是因为天真，“作为伟大的反面：怯懦、狭隘、迎合，是拙劣风格中最低等的。这种天真是什么？很明显难道它不是一种学术态度，过度阐释结果却适得其反。作者创造这种拙劣风格本是为了不同寻常、出类拔萃、令人印象深刻，反倒因毫无意义的矫揉造作，宣告其失败。这些失败无不因为“同样的问题，即如今对新奇想法的狂热”[ 出自亚里士多德，《修辞学》，编辑及翻译：约翰·亨利·菲利斯，麻省剑桥，哈佛大学出版社，Loeb 古典文丛，1926，第419页]。

Surface marks of writing reflect the fundamental stands of individual styles, but surface marks do not constitute styles, and styles do not prescribe surface marks, even though styles can explain such marks. To Aristotle, excellence of style consists in being clear and not commonplace—this is a fundamental stand on the question of presentation. He then examines surface techniques that can help the writer to achieve clarity and distinction, and alerts us to typical errors at the surface level. Aristotle offers many examples, but the discussion of the surface in every case derives from an analysis of the base. Longinus does the same thing, walking us through a great range of surface marks appropriate to sublime style, and contrasting successful examples of the style with failed attempts, but he does not suggest that the style derives from surface marks appropriate to it.

单一风格的基本立场可以从写作的表面特征看出来，但表面特征无法形成风格，风格也没有规定表面特征，即使风格可以解释它们。亚里士多德认为，卓越的风格在于清晰明了，且没有陈词滥调——这是呈现的基本立场。他又检验了表面技巧，帮助作者实现清晰卓越，并提醒我们，基于表面技巧可能犯下的典型错误。亚里士多德举出许多例子，但都是基于基本立场的分析讨论每个案例的表面特征。朗吉弩斯做了同样的事情，向我们详细介绍了有助于实现崇高风格的表面技巧，并对比了成功的例子与失败的例子，但他并不认为风格由对应的表面特征构成。

The many such examples in classical rhetorical treatments, and the use of repeated examples as patterns on which students can model their own writing, should never be interpreted as suggesting that style consists of surface marks, or that if we imitate the surface marks, we achieve the style. This would be as foolish as imagining that by wearing the same kind of shoes as a great athlete and imitating the athlete’s manner of tying the laces, we will become great athletes ourselves. Both Aristotle and Longinus recognize that without the fundamental stand, the surface marks form only a sorry and monstrous parody of the style. Neither of them would have endorsed the procedure of selecting one sentence for inspection and posing the question, “What is the style of this sentence?” For example, the sentence, “He died quietly” could occur with perfect appropriateness in a work whose style is plain, classic, romantic, contemplative, oratorical, sublime, prophetic, practical, or diplomatic. To recognize a style, one must recognize its fundamental stand on decisive questions, which will be reflected with greater or lesser skill in its level of expression.

古典的修辞学论述中有许多这样的例子，学生们重复借鉴一些范例进行仿写，但这并不能说明风格由表面特征构成，也不能说明如果我们模仿表面特征就会实现相应的风格。这非常愚蠢，好像只要想象穿上和伟大运动员一样的鞋子，模仿他们系鞋带的方式，我们就能成为伟大的运动员。亚里士多德和朗吉弩斯都认同：没有基本立场，即使学会表面特征模仿出来的风格会非常差劲、滑稽可笑。两位都不会接受单看一个句子判断：“这个句子是什么风格？”例如，“他安静地死了”这个句子，完全适合不同风格的作品，这些作品的风格可平实、可古典、可浪漫、可沉思、可雄辩、可崇高、可先知、可实用、可外交。要辨识一种风格，必须要了解它在关键问题上采取的基本立场，这在表达层面会体现出更高超或更低劣的技巧。

The closest model in classical antiquity for our analysis of classic style is Longinus’s analysis of “the sublime” in On the Sublime, perhaps the most brilliant treatment of a style ever written.

就古人论述的典型风格，朗吉弩斯在《论崇高》中对“崇高风格”的分析最接近我们对古典风格的分析，它或许是写过的风格中最杰出的论述。

No reader can think that Longinus is trying to give a universal prescription for good writing; he analyzes the distinctive stand of one style, and is always aware that there are many others. Sublime style is distinct from other styles because it takes a distinct stand on the elements of style: truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language. Its cast, unlike the cast of classic style, does not involve a symmetric relationship between equals; its model scene is not conversation; the relationship of language to thought does not have the effect of either presentation or persuasion. “For the effect of genius is not to persuade the audience but rather to transport them out of themselves.” Sublime writing, or writing at moments when it achieves the style of sublimity, consequently has a character entirely different from that of writing whose purpose is to persuade through detailed and systematic argument, for in linear argument, “inventive skill and the due disposal and marshalling of facts gradually emerge from the whole tissue of the composition, rather than showing themselves in one or two touches: on the other hand, a well-timed flash of sublimity scatters everything before it like a bolt of lightning and reveals the full power of the speaker at a single stroke.”

没有读者会想到，朗吉弩斯试图为好的写作下一种普适的规定；他分析一种风格的独特立场，同时总是意识到还有很多其它风格。崇高风格与其它风格不同，是因为它对风格的要素采取了不同的立场：真相、呈现、场景、受众、思想和语言。它的受众，不像古典风格的受众，与作者不是一种对等关系。他的典型场景不是对话；语言与思想的关系既没有呈现的效果，也没有说服的效果。“天才要达到的效果不是说服受众，而是使受众超脱自己之外。”因此崇高的写作，或者常常实现崇高风格的写作，不同于通过详细、有条理的辩论达到说服目的的写作，因为，在线性辩论中，“依据整个构思网络，才能逐步展现创新的技巧，以及处理、组织事实的适当方式，而非通过一两个方面展现出来；另一方面，崇高的光辉在适当的时刻，将像一道闪电一样，一举击出演讲者的全部力量，但在此之前，所有东西还七零八落。”

Longinus situates the origin of sublime style fundamentally at the level of thought, not surface constructions: the prime and most powerful source of the sublime is “the command of full-blooded ideas.” A natural faculty of expression is of course indispensable to sublime style, but cannot provide sublime style. Longinus’s view of the source of sublime style depends upon a view of the relationship between writer and reader as fundamentally asymmetric: the writer is gifted with a fabulous mind and a natural talent for expression, which we admire, and the effect of which is to transport us out of ourselves in ways that otherwise are probably not available to us.

朗吉弩斯认为，崇高风格源于思想而非表面结构：“掌握活跃的思想”是崇高风格最主要最有力量的源泉。天然的表达能力对崇高风格当然不可或缺，但不足以实现崇高风格。朗吉弩斯认为崇高风格源自作者与读者完全不对等的关系：作者天资聪颖，表达能力卓尔超群，令我们羡慕，正是这些天赋让我们超脱自身之外，其它方式可能不足以让我们领略到他们。

Yet for all the asymmetry between writers of the sublime and students of this writing, Longinus offers students a curriculum that might help them cultivate a capacity for the sublime. This curriculum consists not in mastering and parroting certain surface patterns, but rather in training the mind:

尽管崇高风格的作者和这种风格的学生完全不平等，朗吉弩斯提供了学习课程，帮助他们培养崇高风格的能力。这个课程不在于掌握或模仿某些表面模式，而在于训练思想。

> Now, since the first, I mean natural genius, plays a greater part than all the others, here too, although it is rather a gift than an acquired quality, we should still do our best to train our minds into sympathy with what is noble and impregnate them again and again with high inspiration. “How?” you might ask. Well, elsewhere I have written something like this, “Sublimity is the true ring of a noble mind.” And so even without being spoken the bare idea often by itself wins admiration for its inherent genius. . . . In the first place, then, it is absolutely necessary to indicate the sources of the sublime and to show that the mind of the genuine orator must be neither small nor ignoble. For it is impossible that those whose thoughts and habits all their lives long are petty and servile should flash out anything wonderful, worthy of immortal life. No, a great style is the natural outcome of important thoughts, and sublime expressions naturally fall to people with spirit.

> 因为先天的东西，我指的是天生的才能，比所有其它因素更重要，这点同样适用这里。虽然这是一种天赋而非后天习得，我们还是应该努力训练我们的思想，与崇高看齐，让我们的思想不断受到深刻的启发。你可能会问“怎么做到？”。我在别的地方写过类似的东西，“崇高才是高贵思想真正的样子。”即使没说出来，思想本身也会因其固有的天赋令人钦佩……那么首先，完全有必要指明崇高风格的来源，以及表明天才演说家的思想既不会狭隘也不会卑劣。很难想象一生思想狭隘、习惯谄媚的人会闪现出什么美好不朽的想法，绝不可能。伟大的思想生出伟大的风格，这是自然而然的结果，崇高的表达自然也属于胸襟开阔的人。

In the spirit of Longinus, we would like now to clarify the stand of classic style on the elements of style and to contrast classic style with a selection of other mature and consistent styles.

遵循朗吉弩斯的精神，我们现在来阐明古典风格在风格要素上采取的立场，同时对比分析古典风格和其它成熟稳定的风格的异同。
