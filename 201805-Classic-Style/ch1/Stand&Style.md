# Other Stands, Other Styles
# 不同立场，不同风格

There is nothing new in the idea that a style is effectively a stand on a small number of central issues, and therefore that many different mature styles are possible. Classical rhetoricians analyzed contrasting styles from this perspective, and routinely demonstrated that what was good or appropriate to one style might be bad or inappropriate to another. By contrast, many modern books on “style” have, for one reason or another, suggested that there are only two styles: good and bad. On closer inspection, it becomes apparent that each of these modern books is actually about one style, not about style generally. For example, Strunk and White or Williams and Colomb work from an implicit model of writing as meant to be read by either (a) an indefinite audience not defined by working roles but having more-or-less common cultural and social standards; or (b) a somewhat more definite audience of working professionals with corporately defined roles. What Strunk and White recommend is meant as good advice for the one style they have in mind; what Williams and Colomb recommend is good advice for the one style they have in mind. Both assume a single cast and a single scene. But consider texts with quite a different cast or scene, such as a diplomatic address opening peace negotiations in the Middle East, or Pericles’ Funeral Oration, or Samuel Johnson’s “Preface to Shakespeare,” or an address by Martin Luther King, Jr., to a large crowd of political activists. Were we to subject texts of this sort to editorial revision inspired by a careful study of Williams and Colomb or Strunk and White, the result would be simply the destruction of a style. These writers and speakers certainly break many of the “rules” to be found in Style and The Elements of Style, but that is because the styles discussed in those books are foreign to the styles chosen. It is unreasonable to expect that addressing a giant rally in Washington and writing a memo to the vice president for finance on the consequences of the new tax code should have lying behind them the same stylistic stand, or that either one of them should have the same stylistic stand as an article for The New Yorker or Johnson’s explanation of Shakespeare’s claim to our attention.

有一个说不上新鲜的观点，风格其实是对少数关键问题持有的立场，因此，存在多种不同的成熟风格是可能的。古典风格修辞家从这个视角上对比分析了不同风格，通常表现为：对一种风格有益或适宜不一定对另一种风格有益或适宜。相反，现代许多论“风格”的书，由于某种原因暗示只存在两种风格：好风格和坏风格。仔细审视一番，显而易见这些现代书籍只是谈论某一种风格，而非整体风格。比如，Strunk and White or Williams and Colomb暗示写作模式面向两类受众：（a）一类是不确定的受众，不分工作角色，但或多或少有共同的文化和社会标准；（b）一类是比较确定的受众，同属职场专业人士，有确定的公司角色。Strunk and White提出的建议适宜他们自己心中的那种风格，Williams and Colomb提出的建议也只是适宜他们自己心中的那种风格。两者都只表现了一类受众或场景。但想想受众或场景截然不同的文本，比如启动中东地区和平谈判的外交致辞，或Pericles’ 葬礼致辞, or Samuel Johnson’s “Preface to Shakespeare,” 或 an address by Martin Luther King, Jr., 面向一大群政治积极分子的致辞。如果编辑们受Williams and Colomb or Strunk and White的精心研究的启发，照此校订这类文本，结果只是毁掉一种风格。这些作者和演说者违反了许多《风格》和《风格的要素》里提到的规则，但那是因为这两本书谈论的风格并不是他们选用的风格。你不能指望在一次华盛顿巨大的集会上发表演讲和就新税法的意义向财务副总裁写备忘录采用相同的风格立场，也不能指望两者中任何一个的风格与《纽约客》的文章或Johnson’s explanation of Shakespeare’s claim to our attention一样。

Classical textbooks such as Cicero’s Orator, the pseudo-ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Demetrius’s On Style list principal styles and explain their origins in different purposes, motives, or occasions. The standard list includes high, middle, and low style, otherwise called grand, middle, and simple. Demetrius gives instruction in restrained, elevated, elegant, and forcible style. Aristotle in the Rhetoric notes in passing that each kind of rhetoric has its own appropriate style: for example, the style of political speech cannot be the style of forensic speech because their originary purposes, scenes, and casts are opposed.

经典风格的教科书比如Cicero’s Orator, the pseudo-ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Demetrius’s On Style 罗列了主要风格，并从不同的目的、动机和场合解释了它们的起源。标准的列表包括high, middle, and low style，又叫作宏伟、中庸和简约。Demetrius讲授了矜持、文雅、简炼和forcible风格。Aristotle在《修辞学》笔记里提及每种修辞都有它适宜的风格：比如，政治讲话的风格不能是法庭讲话的风格，因为它们初始的目的、场景和受众截然不同。

Classical rhetoricians routinely analyze the relationships between distinct styles. Elegant style, Demetrius explains, can unite with restrained style, but elevated style cannot, because elevated style and restrained style “stand in irreconcilable opposition and contrast”: their fundamental decisions are consistently incompatible.

经典风格的修辞学家常常分析不同风格间的关系。Demetrius解释道，简炼的风格可以和矜持的风格结合，但是文雅的风格不能与之结合，因为文雅的风格和矜持的风格“相互矛盾不可共存”：决定它们的基本因素始终无法兼容。

Certain failures to achieve a successful style are so predictable and common as to constitute styles of their own, which might be called styles that do not succeed. The Rhetorica ad Herennium explains how swollen style, slack style, and meager style arise as particular kinds of failure to achieve grand, middle, or simple style, suggesting that each good style has at least one deformed double. Longinus introduces us to two deformed versions of sublime style, each of which is a product of a particular kind of failure to achieve it. Bloated style “comes from trying to outdo the sublime.” Adolescent style comes from puerility, “the opposite of greatness: abject, mean, smarmy, the lowest of faults. What is this puerility? Isn’t it just obviously the academic attitude, where over-elaboration ends in frigid failure? Writers fall into this fault because they want to be uncommon and exquisite, and to impress everybody, and instead they founder upon the trash of affectation.” Such failures all come “from the same cause, namely, today’s crazy passion for novel ideas.”

未能企及成功的风格不难预料，也很常见，好比建立它们自己的风格，这些风格或许被称作失败的风格。Rhetorica ad Herennium解释了浮夸的风格、懈怠的风格和贫乏meager的风格，是尝试宏伟、中庸和简约风格失败的结果，暗示了每一种好的风格至少有一种对应的拙劣风格。Longinus向我们介绍了与壮丽风格相对的两种拙劣风格，它们因为未能抵达壮丽风格成为一种特定的失败产物。臃肿风格“是因为壮丽过了头”。 Adolescent style稚气风格是因为太孩子气，“伟大的对立面：怯懦、中庸、迎合，是最拙劣的风格。这里的孩子气指什么？难道它不应是一种显然的学术态度，过度阐释却终于黯然失败。作者犯下这种错误，以为可以不同寻常、出类拔萃、给每个人留下深刻印象，却终因毫无意义的矫揉造作溃败。“

Surface marks of writing reflect the fundamental stands of individual styles, but surface marks do not constitute styles, and styles do not prescribe surface marks, even though styles can explain such marks. To Aristotle, excellence of style consists in being clear and not commonplace—this is a fundamental stand on the question of presentation. He then examines surface techniques that can help the writer to achieve clarity and distinction, and alerts us to typical errors at the surface level. Aristotle offers many examples, but the discussion of the surface in every case derives from an analysis of the base. Longinus does the same thing, walking us through a great range of surface marks appropriate to sublime style, and contrasting successful examples of the style with failed attempts, but he does not suggest that the style derives from surface marks appropriate to it.

写作的表面特征能反映个人风格的基本立场，但表面特征并不构成风格，而风格也没有规定表面特征，即使风格可以解释这些特征。Aristotle认为，卓越的风格在于清晰明了，无陈词滥调——这是呈现的基本立场。他然后核查了表层技巧，帮助作者达到清晰卓越，并提醒我们基于表层技巧可能犯下的典型错误。

The many such examples in classical rhetorical treatments, and the use of repeated examples as patterns on which students can model their own writing, should never be interpreted as suggesting that style consists of surface marks, or that if we imitate the surface marks, we achieve the style. This would be as foolish as imagining that by wearing the same kind of shoes as a great athlete and imitating the athlete’s manner of tying the laces, we will become great athletes ourselves. Both Aristotle and Longinus recognize that without the fundamental stand, the surface marks form only a sorry and monstrous parody of the style. Neither of them would have endorsed the procedure of selecting one sentence for inspection and posing the question, “What is the style of this sentence?” For example, the sentence, “He died quietly” could occur with perfect appropriateness in a work whose style is plain, classic, romantic, contemplative, oratorical, sublime, prophetic, practical, or diplomatic. To recognize a style, one must recognize its fundamental stand on decisive questions, which will be reflected with greater or lesser skill in its level of expression.

古典修辞的处理方法中有许多这样的例子，一些重复使用的案例被学生们当做模板，据此塑造自己的写作，这些不应该被解读为风格由表层特征构成，或者解读成如果我们模仿表层特征，就会达到这种风格。这就非常愚蠢，好像只要想象穿上伟大运动员一样的鞋子，模仿他们系鞋带的方式，我们自己就能成为伟大的运动员。Aristotle and Longinus都认为没有基本立场，表面特征只是对这种风格的糟糕模仿，滑稽可笑。他们两个谁都不会接受，只选一个句子审视然后提出问题，“这个句子是什么风格？”例如，“他安静地死了”这个句子，可以恰当完美地出现在一份作品里，这个作品的风格可平实、可古典、可浪漫、可沉思、可雄辩、可壮丽、可先知、可外交。要辨识一种风格，必须辨识它对关键性问题采取的基本立场，这在表达层面会体现出更高超或更低劣的技巧。

The closest model in classical antiquity for our analysis of classic style is Longinus’s analysis of “the sublime” in On the Sublime, perhaps the most brilliant treatment of a style ever written.

在古代的古典风格中，Longinus在《论崇高》中对“崇高风格”的分析最接近我们对古典风格的分析，它或许是写过的风格中最高明的处理方式。

No reader can think that Longinus is trying to give a universal prescription for good writing; he analyzes the distinctive stand of one style, and is always aware that there are many others. Sublime style is distinct from other styles because it takes a distinct stand on the elements of style: truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language. Its cast, unlike the cast of classic style, does not involve a symmetric relationship between equals; its model scene is not conversation; the relationship of language to thought does not have the effect of either presentation or persuasion. “For the effect of genius is not to persuade the audience but rather to transport them out of themselves.” Sublime writing, or writing at moments when it achieves the style of sublimity, consequently has a character entirely different from that of writing whose purpose is to persuade through detailed and systematic argument, for in linear argument, “inventive skill and the due disposal and marshalling of facts gradually emerge from the whole tissue of the composition, rather than showing themselves in one or two touches: on the other hand, a well-timed flash of sublimity scatters everything before it like a bolt of lightning and reveals the full power of the speaker at a single stroke.”

没有读者会想到Longinus试图为好的写作下一种普适的规定；他分析一种风格的独特立场，同时总是意识到还有很多其它风格。崇高风格与其它风格不同是因为它对风格的要素采取了不同的立场：事实、呈现、场景、受众、思想和语言。它的受众，不像古典风格的受众，与作者不是一种对等关系。他的典型场景不是对话；语言与思想的关系既没有呈现的效果也没有说服的效果。“天才要达到的效果不是说服受众，而是使受众超脱自己之外。”崇高的写作，或者常常达到崇高风格的写作，因此与用详细、有条理的辩论达到说服目的的写作截然不同，因为在线性辩论中，“依据整个构思网络，才能逐步展现新意的技巧和处理、组织事实的适当方式，而非通过一两个方面展现出来：另一方面，崇高的光辉在适当的时刻将像一道闪电一样一举击出演讲者的全部力量，但在此之前，所有东西还七零八落。” 

Longinus situates the origin of sublime style fundamentally at the level of thought, not surface constructions: the prime and most powerful source of the sublime is “the command of full-blooded ideas.” A natural faculty of expression is of course indispensable to sublime style, but cannot provide sublime style. Longinus’s view of the source of sublime style depends upon a view of the relationship between writer and reader as fundamentally asymmetric: the writer is gifted with a fabulous mind and a natural talent for expression, which we admire, and the effect of which is to transport us out of ourselves in ways that otherwise are probably not available to us.

Longinus认为崇高风格源于思想而非表面结构：“掌握活跃的思想”是崇高风格最主要最有力量的源泉。天然的表达能力对崇高风格当然不可或缺，但不足以提供崇高风格。Longinus认为作者与读者完全不对等的关系决定了崇高风格的源泉：作者天资聪颖、表达能力卓尔超群，令我们羡慕，正是这些天赋让我们超脱自身之外，其它方式可能不足以让我们领略到他们。

Yet for all the asymmetry between writers of the sublime and students of this writing, Longinus offers students a curriculum that might help them cultivate a capacity for the sublime. This curriculum consists not in mastering and parroting certain surface patterns, but rather in training the mind:

尽管崇高风格的作者和这种风格的学生完全不平等，Longinus提供了学习课程帮助他们培养崇高风格的能力。这个课程不在于某些表层模式的掌握或模仿，而在于思想训练。

Now, since the first, I mean natural genius, plays a greater part than all the others, here too, although it is rather a gift than an acquired quality, we should still do our best to train our minds into sympathy with what is noble and impregnate them again and again with high inspiration. “How?” you might ask. Well, elsewhere I have written something like this, “Sublimity is the true ring of a noble mind.” And so even without being spoken the bare idea often by itself wins admiration for its inherent genius. . . . In the first place, then, it is absolutely necessary to indicate the sources of the sublime and to show that the mind of the genuine orator must be neither small nor ignoble. For it is impossible that those whose thoughts and habits all their lives long are petty and servile should flash out anything wonderful, worthy of immortal life. No, a great style is the natural outcome of important thoughts, and sublime expressions naturally fall to people with spirit.

现在，因为先天的东西，我指的是天生的才能，比所有其它因素更重要，同样适用这里，虽然这是一种天赋而非后天习得，我们还是应该努力训练我们的思想，追随崇高，将我们的思想反反复复浸润在高度启示中。你可能会问“怎么做到？”。我在别的地方写过类似的东西，“崇高才是高贵思想真正的样子。”即使没说出来，思想本身也会因其固有的天赋令人钦佩……那么首先，完全有必要指明崇高风格的来源，以及表明天才演说家的思想既不会卑微也不会龌蹉。很难想象一生思想狭隘、习惯谄媚的人会闪现出什么美好不朽的想法。绝不可能，伟大的思想生出伟大的风格，这是自然而然的结果，崇高的表达自然也只属于胸襟开阔的人

In the spirit of Longinus, we would like now to clarify the stand of classic style on the elements of style and to contrast classic style with a selection of other mature and consistent styles.

遵循Longinus的精神，我们现在来阐明古典风格在风格要素上采取的立场，同时对比分析古典风格和其它成熟稳定的风格的异同。
