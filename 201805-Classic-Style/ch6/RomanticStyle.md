# Classic Style Is Not Romantic Style
# 古典风格不是浪漫风格

Contemplative style is fundamentally about the writer’s thought and often explicitly acknowledges this focus. Romantic style, although not necessarily focused on the writer’s thought in the sense of his analysis or reflection, is always and inescapably about the writer. Romantic prose is a mirror, not a window.

冥想风格本质上关注作者的思考，且并不避讳这点。浪漫风格，尽管不一定聚焦在作者的分析和思考上，却不可避免总与作者相关。浪漫风格的散文是一面镜子，而非一扇窗户。

Romantic style does not separate thought from sensation, memory, and emotion. All these things together are experience. Neither does romantic style distinguish the person who experiences from the experience. The romantic writer therefore cannot be an observer who sees something separate from himself; both the writer and his experience are inseparable elements of a perpetual dialectic in which the writer creates a world, which in its turn creates him. This process is something like the pulse of life. A writer can describe this dynamic relationship, but cannot “present” it and allow it to be verified. 

浪漫风格不会把思想同感受、记忆、情绪分开。所有这些同时构成作者的体验。浪漫风格也不会把体验者和他的体验分离出来。因此，浪漫风格的作者观察事物会把自己考虑进去；作者和作者的体验这两个因素存在永恒的辩证关系，不可分割；在这种关系中，作者创造了一个世界，反过来这个世界也创造了他。这个过程仿佛生命的律动。作者可以描述这种动态关系，但无法“呈现”它，读者也无法证实它。

If contemplative style views writing as an engine of discovery, romantic style looks upon it as an act of creation that both comes from the self and reveals the self.

如果冥想风格把写作视为发现的引擎，浪漫风格则把它看作一种创造行为，两者均源于自身又揭示自身。

The narrator of Proust’s A la recherche du temps perdu offers a striking description of such an act of romantic creation in his account of his first direct encounter with the Duchesse de Guermantes, a woman who had a large place in his imagination before he had ever seen her. The image he cherished has little to do with her—no one but the narrator himself could validate it in a face-to-face encounter with her—but it reveals a great deal about the narrator:

普鲁斯特《寻找失去的时间》（la recherche du temps perdu）这本书的叙述者对他第一次与公爵夫人盖尔基特（见到她之前曾对她有无限遐想）直接相遇的讲述，堪称这种浪漫创造行为的典范。他想象出来的形象与她无关——只有叙述者自己与她面对面相遇时才能验证——但这能透露很多与叙述者相关的信息。

My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a stained-glass window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race.

我无比失望。我忘了当我想起盖尔基特夫人时，她是我大脑想象出来的人物。我想象中的她是花色织锦或彩色玻璃窗的颜色，仿佛生活在另一个世纪，由另一种物质构成，与其它人类不同。

At this point, there is a kind of struggle between the classic outlook and the romantic.

在这点上，古典视角和浪漫视角是某种对抗关系。

. . . I was endeavouring to apply . . . to this fresh and unchanging image, the idea: “It’s Mme de Guermantes”; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes with a space between.

……我眼前这位新形象从未改变过，我努力把她同 “她是盖尔基特夫人”这个想法联系一起；但我只能让这个想法流通在我和我想象的形象中间，好像它们是两个运行在不同平面上的圆盘，平面之间隔着不可跨越的空间。

The Madame de Guermantes whose existence is independent of the narrator’s idea of her does not, however, overcome the Madame de Guermantes who is a defining element of his mentality. He says these words to himself silently but distinctly:

即使叙述者认为她不存在，盖尔基特夫人也依然存在，这个独立的形象战胜了他头脑中盖尔基特夫人的形象。他清晰地默念着这些词句：

“Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Geneviève de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.”

“在查理曼大帝时代之前，盖尔基特家族光辉荣耀，有权决定封臣的生死；公爵夫人的称号从布拉邦特的吉纳维弗德(Geneviève de Brabant)继承而来。她不知道，她也不愿知道今天在这里的任何人。”

His struggle ends with a creative act that allows the narrator to see the romantic truth, one unique to himself, one that could not be shared by anyone else present on the occasion he describes.

他的对抗以一种创造性行为结束，这让叙述者看到了浪漫的真相——对他自己独一无二，但现场其它任何人无法看到的真相。

my eyes resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch: “How lovely she is! What true nobility! It is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant, that I have before me!”

我端详着她金色的秀发、蓝眼睛、脖颈的线条，不去看那些可能让我想起其它女人面容的特征，我欣赏着这种故意留白的轮廓，心里都哭出来了：“她多么可爱！名副其实的贵族！这确实是一位值得骄傲的盖尔基特人，她是布拉邦特的吉纳维弗德的后裔，并非我凭空捏造！”

In contemplative style, which preserves a distinction between observation and the observer’s reflections, it is possible to discover something that is outside of the self and not dependent on the writer for its existence. In romantic style, which observes no such distinction, creation replaces discovery and always depends on the writer for its existence.

在冥想风格中，观察与观察者的思考有所分别，因此可能发生独立自身之外且不依附于作者的发现。浪漫风格没有这种差异，创造取代了发现且往往无法脱离作者独自发生。

Classic writing may present personal material as an instance of a more general truth, but it never presents something that is merely personal or in principle private. For romantic style to rule out personal experience or even experience that is in principle private would reduce the romantic writer to silence. In the theology of this style, the only things anyone can know are personal and in principle private.

古典风格的写作可能展示个人素材，作为例证说明更普遍的真相，但从来不会展示一些纯粹个人的或者原则上非公开的东西。如果让浪漫风格的作者摒弃个人体验甚至原则上非公开的体验，他将无从下笔。这种风格的观念是，任何人能知道的唯一东西都是个人的或原则上非公开的。

Classic style never leaves the writer feeling incomplete, unfulfilled, or incompetent. Classic writers can know something, and once they know it, they can say it. Correction and revision are not infinite, because classic style is a craft that can effectively be learned by learning its parts, none of which is idiosyncratic. Thought and language fit, so it is possible to succeed completely in expressing truth. In romantic style, to separate thought and expression or thought and thinker as separate and fixed realities is to make a false division that leads to false conclusions. In the romantic perspective, writing is not a craft that can be learned, because it is an activity co-extensive with the writer’s person; it cannot be reduced to discrete modules, separate writing jobs that can be completed one after another. There is no complete fit between thought and language because a writer’s thought is not a formed and fixed reality independent of language and capable of being fitted into it.

古典风格从来不会让作者感觉有什么不完全、未实现或不胜任的地方。古典风格的作者能够知道一些事情，一旦知道，就能表达出来。 纠正和修订并非毫无限度，因为古典风格是一种工艺，经过组块学习可以有效习得，没有任何组块是特殊的。思想与语言一致，那么真相就可能完全表达出来。在浪漫风格中，把思想和表达或者把思想和思考者划分为独立、固定的事实，是不对的，得出的结论也不对。在浪漫风格看来，写作并非一种可习得的工艺，而是一种与作者本人共生的活动；它不能被简化为独立模块，拆分成不同写作任务分步完成。语言与思想无法完全匹配，因为作者的思想不是成形、固定的事实——既独立于语言又能与语言相称的事实。

It is a premise of classic style that truth has been perfectly perceived by the writer. The writer’s problem is to articulate that truth perfectly, and in the theology of classic style this problem always has a solution. In romantic style, the writer can know truth romantically and whole, but truth cannot be conceived analytically without a loss of definition, and cannot be put into language without a further loss of definition. In classic style, truth is allied with clarity. In romantic style, clarity can be achieved only at the price of falsification.

古典风格有一个前提，即作者已彻底看清真相。作者的问题是如何完美地表达真相，古典风格相信这个问题总有解决办法。在浪漫风格中，作者了解的真相既浪漫又完整，但分析真相或多或少造成曲解，用言语表达后又会进一步曲解。在古典风格中，真相与清晰是盟友。在浪漫风格中，清晰以曲解为代价。

Both the classic writer and the romantic writer are vulnerable but in entirely different ways. The classic writer is vulnerable because he speaks noncontingent truth to which everybody is vulnerable. The romantic writer is vulnerable because everybody is vulnerable to the conditions of life. The classic writer is always vulnerable to challenge; the romantic writer never. 

古典风格和浪漫风格的作者都很脆弱，但脆弱的方式完全不同。古典风格的作者脆弱是因为每个人容易因理所当然的真相发生感触。浪漫风格的作者脆弱是因为每个人容易因生活的处境引起感触。古典风格的作者容易接受验证；浪漫风格的作者从不接受验证。

When the romantic writer says he dreams of Jeanie with the light brown hair, he yearns for her, he sighs for her, who can check to see whether it is true? He cannot be told he is wrong, for he stands in a special place, with incorrigible knowledge about his entirely private and personal subject matter. If he is wrong, his error is built into the human condition, so no human being can correct him. But the classic writer can be told that he is wrong, because the truth he presents is available to everyone, and can be tested by anyone.

浪漫风格的作者说他梦见了珍妮和她浅棕色的头发，为她感怀，为她叹息。谁能验证它的真假？你不能说他错了，因为他处在一个特殊的立场，他的题材是完全私密和个人化的东西，无法验证修订。如果他错了，他的错误是人类处境的一部分，因此人类无法更正他。但你可以告知古典风格的作者他错了，因为每个人都能看到和验证他呈现的真相。

Of the styles we have discussed, classic and romantic are furthest apart: they take strong fundamentally irreconcilable stands on every one of the elements of style. The distinction between them is as absolute as the distinction Demetrius saw between the restrained and the elevated.  The classic stand on the elements of style is not always opposed in all particulars to the stands of other styles. Between classic style and practical style is an agreement that language is sufficient to express knowable truths. Between classic style and contemplative style is at least a channel for discussion: at least sometimes, truth can be known and language can express it. Between classic style and plain style is a gradient of conceptual refinement. But classic style and romantic style represent irreconcilable conceptual stands. There is no common ground between them, no gradient from one to the other; instead there is something like a permanent and impassable divide.

我们前面讨论过的写作风格中，属古典风格和浪漫风格差别最大：两种风格对每个要素采取的立场本质上无法兼容。两者完全不同，正如德米特里乌斯认为矜持风格和庄严风格有天壤之别。古典风格并非在风格要素的所有细节上都反对其它风格的立场。古典风格和实用风格一致认同语言足以表达可知的真相。古典风格与冥想风格至少有一个共同讨论点：至少有些时候，真相可以被了解，语言也能表达它。古典风格与平实风格则是一种由浅及深的概念关系。但古典风格与浪漫风格的概念立场无法兼容。两者没有共同基础，也不是由此及彼的超越；相反，它们之间似乎存在某种无法跨越的鸿沟。
