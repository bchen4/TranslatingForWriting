# Classic Style Is Not Romantic Style
# 古典风格不是浪漫风格

Contemplative style is fundamentally about the writer’s thought and often explicitly acknowledges this focus. Romantic style, although not necessarily focused on the writer’s thought in the sense of his analysis or reflection, is always and inescapably about the writer. Romantic prose is a mirror, not a window.

深思熟虑风格注重作者的思考，且深知这点。浪漫风格，尽管不一定聚焦在作者的分析和思考上，却也会不可避免涉及到作者。浪漫主义散文是一面镜子，而非一扇窗户。

Romantic style does not separate thought from sensation, memory, and emotion. All these things together are experience. Neither does romantic style distinguish the person who experiences from the experience. The romantic writer therefore cannot be an observer who sees something separate from himself; both the writer and his experience are inseparable elements of a perpetual dialectic in which the writer creates a world, which in its turn creates him. This process is something like the pulse of life. A writer can describe this dynamic relationship, but cannot “present” it and allow it to be verified.

浪漫风格不会把感受，记忆，情绪和思想分开，这些一起构成（作者的）体验。浪漫风格也不会区别一个从经历中体验的人。因此，浪漫主义作家不会成为一个观察者，一个把自己与观察的事物拉开距离，来审视这些事物的观察者；作家创造的世界里，他和自己的体验是不可分割的元素，它们彼此持久，相互辩证，这个世界反过来也创造了他。这个过程仿佛生命的脉动。一位作家可以描绘这种动态的关系，但不能在当下呈现它，并证实它。

If contemplative style views writing as an engine of discovery, romantic style looks upon it as an act of creation that both comes from the self and reveals the self.

如果说深思熟虑风格视写作为一台发现的发动机，浪漫主义风格则把它看做一种创造的行动，两者都来自它们自身以及揭示其自身的过程。

The narrator of Proust’s A la recherche du temps perdu offers a striking description of such an act of romantic creation in his account of his first direct encounter with the Duchesse de Guermantes, a woman who had a large place in his imagination before he had ever seen her.
The image he cherished has little to do with her—no one but the narrator himself could validate it in a face-to-face encounter with her—but it reveals a great deal about the narrator:

普鲁斯特《la recherche du temps perdu》中的叙述者提供了一个引人注目的描述，正体现了这种浪漫的创造行动，即他第一次遇见公爵夫人盖尔基特时，而在这之前她是一名让他无限遐想的的妇女。
他怀有的想象场景与她无关——没有一个人，除了叙述者自己，在面对面遇见它时能验证它——但这揭示出很多叙述者的表达。

My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a stained-glass window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race.

我无比失望，它来自是我空空如也头脑。当我想起盖尔基特夫人，我是在自己的头脑中描绘她的画像，一条五颜六色的挂毯，亦或一扇玻璃上有污渍的窗户，仿佛生活在另一个世纪，仿佛是不同于现有人类物种的另一种物体。

At this point, there is a kind of struggle between the classic outlook and the romantic. I was endeavouring to apply to this fresh and unchanging image, the idea: “It’s Mme de Guermantes”; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes with a space between. The Madame de Guermantes whose existence is independent of the narrator’s idea of her does not, however, overcome the Madame de Guermantes who is a defining element of his mentality. He says these words to himself silently but distinctly: “Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Geneviève de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.” His struggle ends with a creative act that allows the narrator to see the romantic truth, one unique to himself, one that could not be shared by anyone else present on the occasion he describes.

就这点而言，古典视角和浪漫视角彼此对抗。我正努力全神贯注在这个新颖恒常的形象，想法：“这正是盖尔基特夫人”；但我仅让这个想法成功穿越过我和这个形象。犹如他们是一张正在运转的磁盘的两面，运转在一个空间内隔开的两个平面上。盖尔基特夫人的存在独立于叙述者认为她不存在，然而克服盖尔基特夫人，她确实存在于他的头脑中。他向自己清晰地默念着这些词语：在查理曼大帝时代前的伟大与光荣，盖尔基特夫人享有掌握他们家臣生死的权利；盖尔基特从布拉邦特的吉纳维弗德继承了公爵夫人的称号。她不知道这点，她也不愿让任何这个时代的人知道。他的抗争以一种创造性的行动结束，这让叙述者看到了浪漫的真相，一种（真相）对他自己独一无二，一种（真相）则可能不会分享给他描述中当时在场其它任何人。

my eyes resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch: “How lovely she is! What true nobility! It is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant, that I have before me!”
我的眼睛停留在她的金色秀发上，她的蓝眼睛上，修长的脖颈上，进而忽略了一些可能会让我想起其它妇女的容貌特征，我为自己哭出声来，因为我钦佩这种谨慎地未完成的描写：“她多么可爱！多么逼真的贵族！这确实是一位傲慢的盖尔基特人，布拉邦特的吉纳维弗德的后裔，这些早在我之前就有了！”


In contemplative style, which preserves a distinction between observation and the observer’s reflections, it is possible to discover something that is outside of the self and not dependent on the writer for its existence. In romantic style, which observes no such distinction, creation replaces discovery and always depends on the writer for its existence.

深思熟虑风格保留着一种在观察和观察者的思考间的差别，因而这使得发现一些出自（观察）自身的外延且独立于作者存在的东西成为可能。在浪漫风格，则没有这种差别，创造取代了发现，而且创造往往依附作者存在。



Classic writing may present personal material as an instance of a more general truth, but it never presents something that is merely personal or in principle private. For romantic style to rule out personal experience or even experience that is in principle private would reduce the romantic writer to silence. In the theology of this style, the only things anyone can know are personal and in principle private.

经典（古典）写作会采用自己的素材，作为一个更接近一般事实的例子，但它从来不会采用一些仅仅个人的，或者大体上属于私人的素材。而对于浪漫主义风格，作者若摒弃了个人的经历，甚或大体上属于私人的素材，他会无法下笔。在这种风格的理论体系中，任何人都知道的唯一的素材就是个人的或大体上属于私人的素材。

Classic style never leaves the writer feeling incomplete, unfulfilled, or incompetent. Classic writers can know something, and once they know it, they can say it. Correction and revision are not infinite, because classic style is a craft that can effectively be learned by learning its parts, none of which is idiosyncratic. Thought and language fit, so it is possible to succeed completely in expressing truth. In romantic style, to separate thought and expression or thought and thinker as separate and fixed realities is to make a false division that leads to false conclusions. 
In the romantic perspective, writing is not a craft that can be learned, because it is an activity co-extensive with the writer’s person; it cannot be reduced to discrete modules, separate writing jobs that can be completed one after another. There is no complete fit between thought and language because a writer’s thought is not a formed and fixed reality independent of language and capable of being fitted into it.

经典（古典）风格从来不会让作者感到未完成，无法履行，或者无法胜任。古典作家能够获得一些事情，而且一旦他们获得了它，他们就能把他说出来。 修订和纠正不是无穷的，因为古典风格是一们手艺，他能够经由逐步学习习得，学习过程中的每个部分里没有一个部分是特殊的，无法学习的。思想与语言相符，那么完全表达事实就是可能的。在浪漫风格中，为了把思想和表达，或思想和思考者分开，分开的、固定的事实是为了制造一个虚假的界限，这最终导致了虚假的结论。从浪漫主义的视角看，写作并非一门可以习得的手艺，而是一种与作者本人大规模共通的活动；它不能被简化为分离的，独立模块，能够被相继完成的单独的写作工作。思想与语言之间不存在完全的匹配，因为一个作家的思想不是一种成形的，固定的，独立于语言的事实，以及能够匹配思想的事实。


It is a premise of classic style that truth has been perfectly perceived by the writer. The writer’s problem is to articulate that truth perfectly, and in the theology of classic style this problem always has a solution. In romantic style, the writer can know truth romantically and whole, but truth cannot be conceived analytically without a loss of definition, and cannot be put into language without a further loss of definition. In classic style, truth is allied with clarity. In romantic style, clarity can be achieved only at the price of falsification.

古典风格的前提是：事实可以被作者完美的觉察（理解，感知）。作者的问题是清晰完美的表达出事实，在古典风格的理论体系中，这个问题是有解决方法的。在浪漫主义风格中，作者能浪漫地，完整地获得事实，但无法经由分析把事实构思出来，且不失清晰，而且无法诉诸语言不失清晰地表达出来。在古典风格中，事实与清晰一体。在浪漫主义风格中，清晰能够被获得仅仅以歪曲事实为代价。

Both the classic writer and the romantic writer are vulnerable but in entirely different ways. The classic writer is vulnerable because he speaks noncontingent truth to which everybody is vulnerable. The romantic writer is vulnerable because everybody is vulnerable to the conditions of life. The classic writer is always vulnerable to challenge; the romantic writer never. 
When the romantic writer says he dreams of Jeanie with the light brown hair, he yearns for her, he sighs for her, who can check to see whether it is true? He cannot be told he is wrong, for he stands in a special place, with incorrigible knowledge about his entirely private and personal subject matter. If he is wrong, his error is built into the human condition, so no human being can correct him. But the classic writer can be told that he is wrong, because the truth he presents is available to everyone, and can be tested by anyone.

古典风格的作者和浪漫风格的作者都是敏感（脆弱）的，但方式完全不同。古典风格作者之所以脆弱是因为他在向脆弱的大众讲述绝对的事实。浪漫主义作者之所以脆弱是因为大众对生活常态是脆弱的。古典风格作家往往对挑战，质疑是敏感的；浪漫主义作家则从来不会。当浪漫作家说他幻想着珍妮浅棕色的头发，思念她，为她叹息，她能确认这是真实的吗？他不能被告知他是错误的，因为他站在一个特殊的地方，有着无法矫正的关于他所有的私人的，和个人遭遇的事情的知识。如果他错了，他的错误是内置在人类生活常态中，因此没有人会修正他。但古典作家会被告知他错了，因为他采用的素材，人人可见，可得到，也可以被任何人测试。

Of the styles we have discussed, classic and romantic are furthest apart: they take strong fundamentally irreconcilable stands on every one of the elements of style. The distinction between them is as absolute as the distinction Demetrius saw between the restrained and the elevated.  The classic stand on the elements of style is not always opposed in all particulars to the stands of other styles. Between classic style and practical style is an agreement that language is sufficient to express knowable truths. Between classic style and contemplative style is at least a channel for discussion: at least sometimes, truth can be known and language can express it. Between classic style and plain style is a gradient of conceptual refinement. But classic style and romantic style represent irreconcilable conceptual stands. There is no common ground between them, no gradient from one to the other; instead there is something like a permanent and impassable divide.

在我们讨论过写作风格里，古典风格和浪漫风格有天壤之别：两种风格的每个基本要素，在底层理论层面截然不同。它们之间的区别就像德米特里厄斯认为的 restrained 和 elevated 风格的区别一样绝对。古典风格的要素不会总是反对所有特定的，其它风格的要素。古典风格和写实风格在语言足够表达可知的事实这点上观点是一致的。古典风格与深思熟虑风格至少在这点上能讨论到一起：至少有时，事实能被知道，而语言能够表达它。古典风格与朴素风格则是一个概念上的改良。但古典风格与浪漫风格代表了无法兼容的概念主张。它们之间没有一个共同的基准，也没有从一个到另一个的过度；相反，他们之间存在的是固有的，无法跨越的鸿沟。
