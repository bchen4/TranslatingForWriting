"The most popular book on prose style is The Elements of Style by Strunk and White; I recommend it, although it is preoccupied with usage, punctuation, and grammar.The best book I have read on the substance of prose style is Thomas and Turner, Clear and Simple as the Truth; it deals mainly with one specific style, although others are considered along the way." 
— Herbert S. Bailey, Jr., former director of Princeton University Press.

"Clear and Simple as the Truth has a scope and relevance that exceeds its ostensible subject. It is a treatment of classic style that manifests the virtues of the writing it propounds, expounds, and exemplifies in a wealth of fascinating passages, brilliantly analyzed."
— M. H. Abrams, Cornell University

"Could well be the most important discussion of style since the great classical rhetoricians. It will certainly join the small list of style-guides that are permanently useful."
— Wayne C. Booth, University of Chicago

"Clear and Simple as the Truth is a work of great intellectual elegance and power. I have read it with a lot of pleasure, admiring the wisdom and economy of its reflections and the extraordinary range of its citations. Thomas and Turner have made a powerful case for civilized and intelligent discourse, and have done it without hectoring or polemical reductiveness." 
— Claude Rawson, Yale University

"Clear and Simple as the Truth holds the promise of raising the level of the nation's prose. Thomas and Turner will have the literate nonacademic reader on their side from the outset and will win over most of the others through the sheer force of their passage-by-passage analysis. The book is full of cogency and insight." 
— Frederick Crews, University of California, Berkeley

"The best-known book about writing, Strunk & White's The Elements of Style, offers an elaborate list of do's and don'ts. Individually, these capsules of advice can be useful, but learn them all and you still won't know how to write. Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner have taken an entirely different approach in Clear and Simple. . . . [I]t is filled with enough general advice to benefit anyone who writes anything." 
— Christopher Ott, Writers' Journal.

"Every once in a while a book comes along with the power to alter permanently the view of a subject you thought you knew well. For me this year, that book is Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose." 
— Denis Dutton, Philosophy and Literature.

### Francis-Noël Thomas
My work as a scholar centers on how particular ways of organizing concepts become commonplace. My areas of special knowledge are iconography—the diffusion of ideas through pictures—and the history of literary interpretation—the history of reading as a form of human thought.
