古典风格选段一

> You imagine what you desire; you will what you imagine; and at last, you create what you will.
> 你想象你所渴望之物；你臆想你所想象之物；最后，你创造你所臆想之物。

—Bernard Shaw, the serpent speaking to Eve in Back to Methuselah
—萧伯纳剧作《回到玛士撒拉时代》中蛇对夏娃说


The thought expressed in this passage has three steps. They are schematically identical. In each, an activity is located and then linked to its source in a different activity. There is a sentence expressing each step. Each of these sentences inherits the schematic structure of the thought, as in “You imagine what you desire.” Paired activities are expressed as paired clauses—“you imagine” and “you desire”—and the conceptual link between paired activities is mirrored in the linguistic link between paired clauses.
该段落表达的思想有三个步骤，它们的图式结构几乎完全相同。每一步，生成一项活动，该活动又关联着它的源头活动，后者还构成另一项不同活动。每一个句子对应一个步骤，每句话继承了思想的图式结构，比如“你想象你所渴望之物”，成对的活动表现为成对的从句——“你想象”和“你渴望”——这对活动中的概念关系反映在这对从句的语言关系中。

These three steps are not independent, but are ordered as a temporal sequence in which the product of one step serves as the source of the next. The grammatical structure mirrors this conceptual sequence: three sentences of the same grammatical form occur in linear order; the clause referring to the product in one sentence serves to refer to the source in the next.
这三个步骤并非相互独立，而是以时间顺序递进。一个步骤生成的活动是下一个步骤的源起活动。段落语法结构反映了其概念顺序：语法形式相同的三个句子以线性秩序排列；从句描述一个句子生成的活动，也将描述下一个句子的源起活动。

Shaw’s passage—with its precise and detailed combination of `schematic images`—is the result of conceptual and linguistic work, but the work is not exhibited. Reading the sentence is like watching a champion gymnast perform a routine on the parallel bars. Obviously the gymnastic performance is the result of previous work, but only the achievement is exhibited.
萧伯纳的段落——以准确又详细的图式意象组合`——是语言和概念构思的结果，但这个构思过程没有展现出来。读这些句子犹如观看体操冠军表演一套双杠动作。很显然，这套体操表演是先前训练的结果，但只把成果展现了出来。

The achievement is final. In the classic view, thought comes first and language is sufficient to express it. Any problem of expression has an exact solution in the language, and this solution, once found, will appear to be obvious, perfect, and definitive. The writer knows when he has finished revising.
成果是终极表现。在古典视角中，思想先行，语言足以表达。任何表达问题都可以在语言中找到恰到好处的解决方案,这解决方案一旦被发现，则看起来理所当然，完美无瑕，不可动摇。写作的人知道什么时候才算修订完成。

Perfection of phrasing in classic style is assumed to follow from precision of preceding thought. The classic writer draws precise conceptual distinctions and locates exact conceptual relations until the analysis is finished. He then expresses the result of this analysis. Its schematic conceptual structure is mirrored in the schematic linguistic structure. Often, the result appears to be something like a mathematical formulation.
古典风格措辞完美被认为是先行思想准确的结果。直到分析结束，古典作家才能准确把握概念差异和概念关系，然后表达出这种分析的结果，其概念的图式结构则体现在语言的图式结构中。通常表达结果呈现出某种形态，像数学公式一样。

`In classic style, the goal of analysis is truth in its most efficient form consistent with accuracy`. Expression, carrying the elegance that comes from `compressed energy`, is like a perfectly tuned stringed instrument: the strings are taut to exact degrees to correspond to exact pitches that stand in exact relations to one another. The pitches and their relations exist before the strings are tuned. Each string is tuned to a pitch and the results are judged by comparison to this pre-existing reality. A musician tuning an instrument is not finished until everything is exactly right, but once it is exactly right, there is simply nothing left to do.
古典风格的分析目标是用最高效的形式使事实符合准确的标准。表达，因为收紧的能量而优雅，就像完美调弦的乐器。每根弦紧绷到特定程度对应特定的音调，确保音调间彼此严谨的关系。琴弦开始调试之前，它们的音调和彼此的关系就已存在。每根琴弦调试到一个音调，演奏结果经比较预先存在的现实可判断。音乐家调试琴弦，全部都对了才算完成，一旦对了，也就没什么可做的了。

Similarly, in the classic view, the thought exists before the expression, and the expression is judged by comparing it with the pre-existing thought. In writing a sentence, a writer knows when he has it exactly right, after which there is nothing left to do.
类似地，古典视角认为思想在表达之前存在，判断表达的结果需将其与预先存在的思想进行比较。作家写一个句子，知道什么时候才是表达准确，之后就没什么可做的了。

`Shaw’s sentence knows when to stop` because it expresses a complete analysis. It might be contrasted with the following passage—written by an editor for the influential journal he edits—which isn’t over even when it is over.
萧的句子因为表达出完整的分析，知道何时结束。将它同以下段落比较——一位编辑为他负责编辑的一本有影响力的杂志写的一段话——段落虽然结束但没有完成。

> The concept of spatial form has unquestionably been central to modern criticism not only of literature but of the fine arts and of language and of culture in general. Indeed, the consistent goal of the natural and human sciences in the twentieth century has been the discovery and/or construction of synchronic structural models to account for concrete phenomena.
> 空间形式的概念无疑对现代批评极为重要，不仅是文学评判，通常还有美术批评、语言批评和文化批评。事实上，20世纪的自然科学和人文科学持之以恒的目标是发现和（或）构建解释具体现象的共时结构模式。

Classic style is not exclusive. A writer’s position or status cannot make her a classic writer, or bar her from becoming a classic writer. An undergraduate at a junior college wrote the following classic passage in her discussion of the spatial form of Rembrandt’s Old Man with a Gold Chain:
古典风格不是某类群体的专属。一个作家的职务或身份无法成就或妨碍一位古典作家。一个专科学校的本科生在讨论伦勃朗《戴金项链的老者》的空间形式时写下下面这段古典段落：

> Rembrandt was a very young man when he painted this picture, but it is a work demonstrating the insight and wisdom of an older man. It is a poignant picture and painful to look upon because it is not just a painting of a man, but an expression of mortality.
> 伦勃朗画这幅画时是一位非常年轻的小伙子，但这幅画体现的洞见和智慧犹如他是一位比实际年龄更年长的人。这是一幅悲楚的画，看着令人痛苦，因为他不仅是一个人的画像，也是一种对死亡的表达。
